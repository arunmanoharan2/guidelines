### INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
The following Coverage Policy applies to health benefit plans administered by Cigna Companies. Certain Cigna Companies and/or lines of business only provide utilization review services to clients and do not make coverage determinations. References to standard benefit plan language and coverage determinations do not apply to those clients. Coverage Policies are intended to provide guidance in interpreting certain standard benefit plans administered by Cigna Companies. Please note, the terms of a customer’s particular benefit plan document [Group Service Agreement, Evidence of Coverage, Certificate of Coverage, Summary Plan Description (SPD) or similar plan document] may differ significantly from the standard benefit plans upon which these Coverage Policies are based. For example, a customer’s benefit plan document may contain a specific exclusion related to a topic addressed in a Coverage Policy. In the event of a conflict, a customer’s benefit plan document always supersedes the information in the Coverage Policies. In the absence of a controlling federal or state coverage mandate, benefits are ultimately determined by the terms of the applicable benefit plan document. Coverage determinations in each specific instance require consideration of 1) the terms of the applicable benefit plan document in effect on the date of service; 2) any applicable laws/regulations; 3) any relevant collateral source materials including Coverage Policies and; 4) the specific facts of the particular situation. Each coverage request should be reviewed on its own merits. Medical directors are expected to exercise clinical judgment where appropriate and have discretion in making individual coverage determinations. Where coverage for care or services does not depend on specific circumstances, reimbursement will only be provided if a requested service(s) is submitted in accordance with the relevant criteria outlined in the applicable Coverage Policy, including covered diagnosis and/or procedure code(s). Reimbursement is not allowed for services when billed for conditions or diagnoses that are not covered under this Coverage Policy (see “Coding Information” below). When billing, providers must use the most appropriate codes as of the effective date of the submission. Claims submitted for services that are not accompanied by covered code(s) under the applicable Coverage Policy will be denied as not covered. Coverage Policies relate exclusively to the administration of health

benefit plans. Coverage Policies are not recommendations for treatment and should never be used as treatment guidelines. In certain markets, delegated vendor guidelines may be used to support medical necessity and other coverage determinations.

# Coverage Policy

## POLICY STATEMENT
The Inflammatory Conditions Preferred Specialty Management Program has been developed to encourage the use of the Preferred Products. For all medications, this program requires the patient to meet the respective standard *Prior Authorization Policy* criteria. Additionally, this program requires trial(s) of the Preferred Product(s) according to the table above, when clinically appropriate, prior to the approval of the Non-Preferred Products. There are also situations when trials of Non-Preferred Products will be considered; see criteria below. Other details of the program are as follows:
*   **Continuation of Therapy:** Approval for a patient <u>continuing therapy with a **Non-Preferred (subcutaneous or oral) Product**</u> must be supported with verification, noted in the criteria as either **[verification in prescription claims history required]** or, if not available, as **[verification by prescriber required]**.
    - If the patient has at least 130 days of prescription claims history on file, claims history must support that the patient has received the Non-Preferred Product for the specified period of time (90 or 120 days) within a 130-day look-back period; OR
    - When 130 days of the patient’s prescription claim history file is unavailable for verification, the prescriber must verify that the patient has been receiving the Non-Preferred Product for a specified period of time (90 or 120 days), AND that the patient has been receiving the Non-Preferred Product via paid claims (e.g., patient has **not** been receiving samples or coupons or other types of waivers in order to obtain access to the Non-Preferred Product).
    - For a patient continuing therapy, other conditions may also apply. Refer to criteria below.

**Approval Duration:** All approvals for continuation of therapy for Preferred and Non-Preferred Products are provided for 1 year unless noted otherwise below. In cases where the initial approval is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days.
