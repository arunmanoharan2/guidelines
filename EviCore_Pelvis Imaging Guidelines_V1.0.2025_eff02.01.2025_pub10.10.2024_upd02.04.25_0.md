Pelvis Imaging Guidelines    V1.0.2025

# General Guidelines (PV-1.0)

**PV.GG.0001.0.A**  
**v1.0.2025**

* A current clinical evaluation since the onset or change in symptoms is required before advanced imaging can be considered. The clinical evaluation should include a relevant history and physical examination including a pelvic and/or urological exam, appropriate laboratory studies, and non-advanced imaging modalities such as plain x-ray or Pelvic ultrasound (CPT® 76856 or CPT® 76857) and/or Transvaginal ultrasound (CPT® 76830) and/or Transperineal ultrasound (CPT® 76872).  
  - Other meaningful contact (telehealth visit, telephone call, electronic mail or messaging) since the onset or change in symptoms for follow up visit by an established individual can substitute for a face-to-face clinical evaluation.
* The use of gynecology CPT codes for pregnant females is not supported. Therefore, transvaginal ultrasound (CPT® 76830) and pelvic ultrasound (CPT® 76856 or CPT® 76857) are not supported for those with a positive pregnancy test or known pregnancy. If a pregnancy test is positive, then obstetrical CPT codes are indicated.
* The uterus, tubes and ovaries arise out of the pelvis and are considered pelvic organs. If the uterus rises out of the pelvic cavity, the imaging field can be determined on scout films. Imaging of the abdomen is not routinely supported for problems suspected to arise from the pelvis unless specifically described in other areas of the guidelines.
* The scout images (CT) and localizer images (MRI) are used to define the imaging field that is relevant to anatomical structures of clinical interest. The imaging field is defined by this clinical question, not by the imaging procedure code. The imaging code indicates the general anatomical region but does not define the specific imaging protocol or sequences.

Pelvis Imaging Guidelines    V1.0.2025

# General Guidelines – Overview (PV-1.1)

**PV.GG.0001.1.A**  
**v1.0.2025**

* When indicated, pregnant females should be evaluated with ultrasound or MRI without contrast to avoid radiation exposure. In carefully selected clinical circumstances, evaluation with CT may be considered with careful attention to technique and radiation protection as deemed clinically appropriate.

## Ultrasound
* Transvaginal ultrasound is the recommended modality for imaging; no alternative modality has demonstrated sufficient superiority to justify routine use, and Transvaginal (TV) ultrasound (CPT® 76830) is the optimal study to evaluate adult female pelvic pathology.
* Pelvic ultrasound (complete CPT® 76856, or limited CPT® 76857) is supported if it is a complementary study to the TV ultrasound. It may substitute for TV in pediatric individuals or non-sexually active females.
* Transperineal ultrasound (CPT® 76872) is supported for cases of suspected urethral abnormalities, urinary incontinence, pelvic prolapse, or vaginal cysts.
* CPT® 76942 is used to report ultrasound imaging guidance for needle placement during biopsy, aspiration, and other percutaneous procedures.

## Soft Tissue Ultrasound
* Pelvic wall, buttocks, and penis - CPT® 76857

## Scrotal Ultrasound
* See  
  - **Impotence/Erectile Dysfunction (PV-17.1)**  
  - **Penis-Soft Tissue Mass (PV-18.1)**
* Ultrasound scrotum and contents - CPT 76870

## 3D Rendering with Ultrasound
* 3D Rendering (CPT® 76376 or CPT® 76377)  
  - CPT® 76377 (3D rendering requiring image post-processing on an independent work station) or CPT® 76376 (3D rendering not requiring image post-processing on an independent workstation) in the following clinical scenarios:  
    - Uterine intra-cavitary lesion when initial ultrasound is equivocal (See **Abnormal Uterine Bleeding (AUB) (PV-3.1)** and **Leiomyoma/Uterine Fibroids (PV-12.1)**)

Pelvis Imaging Guidelines    V1.0.2025

* Hydrosalpinges or peritoneal cysts when initial ultrasound is equivocal (See **Complex Adnexal Masses (PV-5.3)**)
* Lost IUD (inability to feel or see IUD string) with initial ultrasound (See **Intrauterine Device (PV-10.1)**)
* Uterine anomaly is suspected on ultrasound (See **Uterine Anomalies (PV-14.1)**)
* Infertility if ultrasound is indeterminate or there is clinical suspicion for intra-cavitary lesion (such as polyp or fibroid), hydrosalpinx, uterine synechia, adenomyosis or uterine anomalies (See **Initial Infertility Evaluation, Female (PV-9.1)**)

* There is currently insufficient data to generate appropriateness criteria for the use of 3D and 4D rendering in conjunction with Obstetrical ultrasound imaging. Per ACOG, proof of a clinical advantage of 3-dimensional ultrasonography in prenatal diagnosis, in general, is still lacking.
* 3D-4D (CPT® 76376 or CPT® 76377) rendering can be used in certain situations of abnormal pregnancy implantation like suspected C-section scar pregnancies or suspected cornual (interstitial) ectopic pregnancy, or to locate an IUD.
* 3D-4D (CPT® 76376 or CPT® 76377) rendering can be used for surgical planning with diagnosis of complex CHD in the fetus or for surgical planning of other complex fetal malformations.

## Other Ultrasound
* CPT® 93975 Duplex scan (complete) of arterial inflow and venous outflow of abdominal, pelvic, scrotal contents and/or retroperitoneal organs; complete study.
* CPT® 93976 Duplex scan (limited) of arterial inflow and venous outflow of abdominal, pelvic, scrotal contents and/or retroperitoneal organs; limited study.
* CPT® 93975 and CPT® 93976 should not be reported together during the same session.

## CT
* CT is not generally warranted for evaluating pelvic anatomy because it is limited due to soft tissue contrast resolution.

## MRI
* Can be used as a more targeted study or for individuals allergic to iodinated contrast.
  - MRI Pelvis without contrast (CPT® 72195)
  - MRI Pelvis without and with contrast (CPT® 72197)
  - MRI Pelvis with contrast only (CPT® 72196) is rarely performed

Pelvis Imaging Guidelines    V1.0.2025

# Evidence Discussion (PV-1.1)

* Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the imaging techniques of choice for the pregnant patient, they should be used prudently and only when use is expected to answer a relevant clinical question.
* CT is not generally warranted for evaluating pelvic anatomy because it is limited due to soft tissue contrast resolution. Computed tomography (CT) scans are generally not recommended during pregnancy unless the benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks. Computed tomography (CT) scan if necessary in addition to ultrasonography or MRI or if more readily available for the diagnosis in question, should not be withheld from a pregnant patient. The risk of adverse effects from ionizing radiation should always be weighed against the risk of not performing the procedure and the benefit derived from the procedure.
* Ultrasound is the recommended modality for imaging the female pelvis; no alternative modality has demonstrated sufficient superiority to justify routine use, and transvaginal ultrasound is the optimal study to evaluate adult female pelvic pathology. Transabdominal pelvic ultrasound is a useful complementary study to transvaginal ultrasound and may substitute for transvaginal ultrasound in pediatric individuals or non-sexually active females. The American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM.org) launched an initiative in 2012 "Ultrasound First," which advocates the use of ultrasound examinations before other imaging modalities when the evidence shows that ultrasound imaging is at least equally, if not more, effective for the target anatomic area. This applies particularly to obstetric and gynecologic patients for whom a skillfully performed and well-interpreted ultrasound image usually obviates the need to proceed to additional more costly and complex cross-sectional imaging techniques.
* Transperineal ultrasound can be useful for cases of suspected urethral abnormalities, urinary incontinence, pelvic prolapse, or vaginal cysts. A study by Yang, et al confirmed transvaginal or transperineal ultrasound to be a non-invasive and cost-effective modality for diagnosis of urethral and periurethral masses. Vaginal and urethral imaging is limited on transvaginal ultrasound due to the position of the endovaginal probe rendering the vagina out of the field, on computed tomography (CT) due to poor soft tissue discrimination of the vaginal walls and on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI of the vagina should be done with thin slice thickness and proper choice of the degree of angulation and used MR sequence, otherwise there is limited evaluation of the vagina. Transperineal ultrasound is also a dynamic real-time examination, and can detect subtle abnormalities that are not seen in static imaging.
* Scrotal ultrasound is supported for evaluation of scrotal pain or suspected mass. The American Urological Association recommends scrotal ultrasound for initial evaluation of unilateral or bilateral scrotal mass suspicious for neoplasm.
* Three-dimensional (3D) rendering with ultrasound can be considered when ultrasound shows suspected uterine anomaly, uterine intra-cavitary lesion,

hydrosalpinges or peritoneal cysts. A study by Laskshmy et al found 3D ultrasound to be a highly sensitive and specific tool for accurately diagnosing congenital uterine anomalies. 3D rendering has shown a high degree of concordance with MRI and laparoscopy for congenital uterine anomalies, and is non-invasive, readily available and relatively cost-effective. Three-dimensional ultrasound is a noninvasive method for evaluation of adnexal pathology.

* Doppler scan can be of benefit in addition to ultrasound for further evaluation of suspected uterine or ovarian abnormalities. Doppler flow mapping is useful in diagnosing submucosal fibroids and endometrial polyps. Per ACOG (American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology), color Doppler ultrasonography is useful to evaluate the vascular characteristics of adnexal masses. MRI pelvis is useful in cases such as inconclusive ultrasound for adenomyosis, "MRI is a second-line examination in the diagnosis of internal adenomyosis, mainly after a non-conclusive US evaluation. In addition, MRI can differentiate between the subtypes of adenomyosis." MRI pelvis is also useful for further evaluation of indeterminate adnexal masses. A study by Dirrichs, et al found MRI to improve sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis of indeterminate adnexal masses detected at TVUS, and use of MRI changed therapeutic management in 34% of cases. MRI can aid in the diagnosis of deep pelvic endometriosis. MRI pelvis is useful for further evaluation of unexplained pelvis pain when ultrasound evaluation is inconclusive. Pelvic MRI is useful for evaluation of fibroids prior to uterine-sparing interventional techniques. "Although a high-quality ultrasonography (US) examination may be sufficient for evaluation in patients with straightforward cases of fibroids (for instance to estimate the size of a dominant fibroid), imaging evaluation is most reliably performed with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to determine the characteristics, number, size, and location of fibroids and to assess for other pathologic conditions such as adenomyosis."

Pelvis Imaging Guidelines    V1.0.2025

# Abnormal Uterine Bleeding (AUB) (PV-2.1)

**PV.UB.0002.1.A**  
*v1.0.2025*

* Pregnancy test should be done initially if premenopausal  
* If pregnancy test is negative or post menopausal initial evaluation includes ANY or ALL of the following:  
  - Pelvic ultrasound (CPT® 76856 or CPT® 76857) and/or Transvaginal ultrasound (CPT® 76830), D&C and/or endometrial biopsy  
* Advanced imaging is not indicated for Endometrial Intraepithelial Neoplasia or Atypical Endometrial Hyperplasia (EIN-AEH)  
* In females with postmenopausal bleeding  
  - Those with thickened endometrium on ultrasound, those whose ultrasound failed to identify a thin, distinct endometrial strip and/or those with continued vaginal bleeding should all undergo endometrial sampling to rule out endometrial carcinoma  
* If biopsy confirms a malignancy, then see the appropriate oncology guideline.  
* If ultrasound is equivocal for intracavitary lesion  
  - Duplex (Doppler) scan (CPT® 93975 complete; CPT® 93976 limited) as an add-on to TV ultrasound (CPT® 76830).  
  - 3-D Rendering (CPT® 76377 or CPT® 76376) as an add-on.  
* If ultrasound is equivocal for an intracavitary lesion, saline infusion sonohysterography (CPT® 76831) may be indicated.  
* CT is not generally warranted for evaluating AUB since uterine anatomy is limited due to soft tissue contrast resolution.  
  - An abnormal endometrium found incidentally on CT should be referred for TV ultrasound for further evaluation.  
* MRI is not indicated for evaluation of abnormal uterine bleeding, please see specific Pelvis Imaging sections for MRI indications for ultrasound findings such as adnexal mass or uterine fibroids. See **Adnexal Mass/Ovarian Cysts (PV-5)** and **Leiomyomata (PV-12.1)**.

## Evidence Discussion (PV-2.1)

* Transabdominal pelvic and/or transvaginal pelvic ultrasound are widely accepted as the initial imaging modality of choice for evaluation of abnormal uterine bleeding. Ultrasound also allows for real-time evaluation with color and power Doppler which can help identify vascular flow and distinguish fluid and cysts from soft tissue. Additional benefits to ultrasound as a first line imaging modality include wide

* availability, fast access, and lack of ionizing radiation exposure. 3-D Rendering has been shown to a useful adjunct for analysis of suspected lesions the endometrial cavity.
* MRI is not supported as an initial imaging modality for the diagnosis of abnormal uterine bleeding. While MRI is accepted as an adjunct modality to ultrasound in cases where ultrasound may not fully characterize a soft tissue abnormality, imaging should be directed by the type of suspected soft tissue abnormality (i.e. adenomyosis, endometriosis, fibroids, and adnexal mass) and is addressed in additional sections of these guidelines. CT is of limited use in the evaluation of abnormal uterine bleeding given its suboptimal evaluation of the soft tissue of female pelvic organs.
* In premenopausal women presenting with abnormal uterine bleeding a pregnancy test should be performed. For those with a positive pregnancy test, imaging with appropriate obstetric ultrasound should be performed.
* Vaginal bleeding is the presenting symptom in 90% of postmenopausal women with endometrial cancer. An endometrial strip of 4mm or less on ultrasound has been found to have a greater than 99% negative predictive value for endometrial cancer. However, this cutoff may be inadequate in Black women, as it missed five-fold more cases than in White women. Endometrial tissue sampling remains the gold standard for diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma. As such, those with thickened endometrium on ultrasound, those who ultrasound failed to identify a thin, distinct endometrial strip and those with continued vaginal bleeding should all undergo endometrial sampling to rule out endometrial carcinoma.
* The incidence of concurrent endometrial cancer with the diagnosis of Endometrial Intraepithelial Neoplasia or Atypical Endometrial Hyperplasia (EIN-AEH) is approximately 30% to 50%. This makes evaluation for concurrent carcinoma imperative in the diagnosis of EIN-AEH for those considering a fertility-sparing treatment. The most accurate method for diagnosis is hysteroscopic-guided uterine sampling which has the added benefit of direct visualization of any intrauterine pathology such as endometrial polyps.

Pelvis Imaging Guidelines    V1.0.2025

# Retained Products of Conception (PV-2.2)

**PV.UB.0002.2.A**  
*v1.0.2025*

* For abnormal uterine bleeding and/or pelvic pain with concern for retained products of conception (RPOC):  
  - Pelvic ultrasound (CPT® 76856 or CPT® 76857) and/or Transvaginal ultrasound (CPT® 76830) is supported one time, repeat US is indicated for continued symptoms  
  - Color Doppler ultrasonography (CPT® 93975 or CPT® 93976) may be added to ultrasound to aid in diagnosis of RPOC  
  - CT Pelvis with and without contrast (CPT® 72194) OR MRI Pelvis with and without contrast (CPT® 72197) is supported if US with Color Doppler is equivocal AND further imaging is needed for surgical planning  

## Evidence Discussion (PV-2.2)

* Transabdominal pelvic and/or transvaginal pelvic ultrasound are widely accepted as the initial imaging modality of choice for evaluation of suspected retained products of conception (RPOC). Ultrasound also allows for real-time evaluation with color and power Doppler which can help identify vascular flow within the endometrial complex, which improves the specificity and negative predictive value of detecting RPOC. Additional benefits to ultrasound as a first line imaging modality include wide availability, fast access, and lack of ionizing radiation exposure.  
* For most cases ultrasound is sufficient for detection of RPOC. For cases where ultrasound is inconclusive additional imaging with MRI or CT may provide additional information to aid in surgical planning.

# Secondary Amenorrhea (PV-3.1)

**PV.AM.0003.1.A**  
**v1.0.2025**

* Pregnancy test should be done initially  
* If a pregnancy test is positive:  
  - Refer to the member's individual coverage policy regarding obstetrical imaging indications and appropriate obstetrical imaging procedural codes. Billing of gynecology codes during pregnancy is not supported.  
* If a pregnancy test is negative, further evaluation includes any of the following:  
  - FSH, TSH, estradiol, and/or prolactin levels are indicated depending on clinical suspicion.  
  - Serum free and total testosterone and/or DHEAS levels are indicated if there is evidence of hyperandrogenism  
  - Pelvic ultrasound (CPT® 76856 or CPT® 76857) and/or TV ultrasound (CPT® 76830) for suspected uterine or ovarian pathology  
* The results of test(s) above determine the next steps, which include:  
  - For suspected adrenal tumor, See **Adrenal Cortical Lesions (AB-16)** in the Abdomen Imaging Guidelines.  
  - For suspected pituitary tumor, See **Pituitary (HD-19)** in the Head Imaging Guidelines  
  - For suspected Asherman's Syndrome:  
    * Hysterosalpingogram (CPT® 74740), sonohysterosalpingography (CPT® 76831), and/or hysteroscopy if ultrasound is indeterminate for Asherman's syndrome.  
    * MRI Pelvis without contrast (CPT® 72195) or without and with contrast (CPT® 72197) if hysterosalpingogram (CPT® 74740), sonohysterosalpingography (CPT® 76831), or hysteroscopy is indeterminate for Asherman's Syndrome.

# Primary Amenorrhea (PV-3.2)

**PV.AM.0003.2.A**  
**v1.0.2025**

* Prior to imaging a history, physical examination and Tanner stage should be evaluated.  
* Initial evaluation may include pelvic ultrasound (CPT® 76856 or CPT® 76857) and/or TV ultrasound (CPT® 76830) if ANY of the following:  
  - Normal pubertal development and negative pregnancy test  
  - Pelvic exam is indeterminate or unable to be performed  
  - Delayed puberty with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) or luteinizing hormone (LH) that is elevated for the individual's age and Tanner stage  
* If ultrasound defines a uterine or vaginal anomaly see **Uterine Anomalies (PV-14.1)**  
* For suspected pituitary tumor, See **Pituitary (HD-19)** in the Head Imaging Guidelines  

## Background and Supporting Information

* Evaluation of an individual without a uterus (determined by imaging or examination) may include karyotype and/or testosterone levels.  
* TV ultrasound (CPT® 76830) is appropriate in pediatric individuals who are sexually active or use a tampon and consent to the study.  

## Evidence Discussion (PV-3)

* The initial work up of amenorrhea should include a physical exam, pregnancy test and hormonal work up. For those with a positive pregnancy test, imaging with appropriate obstetric ultrasound should be performed. Hormonal testing can help to further direct appropriate imaging.  
* Transabdominal pelvic and/or transvaginal pelvic ultrasound are widely accepted as the initial imaging modality of choice for evaluation of amenorrhea. Ultrasound also allows for real-time evaluation with color and power Doppler which can help identify vascular flow and distinguish fluid and cysts from soft tissue. Additional benefits to ultrasound as a first line imaging modality include wide availability, fast access, and lack of ionizing radiation exposure.  
* MRI is supported as an adjunct to inconclusive ultrasound imaging, especially if the ultrasound is suggestive of a congenital uterine or vaginal anomaly. CT is of limited use in the evaluation of amenorrhea given its suboptimal evaluation of the soft tissue of female pelvic organs.  
* For suspected Asherman's syndrome, the gold standard for diagnosis remains hysteroscopy which has the added benefit of allowing for simultaneous treatment of adhesive disease. However, hysteroscopy carries with it risks of anesthesia and uterine perforation. Hysterosaplingogram (HSG) allows for simultaneous evaluation of

tubal patency. Sonohsyterography (SHG) has a high negative predictive value (98%), but only a modest positive predictive value (43%). MRI may be a useful adjunct to HSG, SHG and hysteroscopy, especially in cases where there is complete obstruction of the endometrial cavity limiting the diagnostic ability of these tests.

* TV ultrasound (CPT® 76830) and/or Pelvic ultrasound (CPT® 76856 or CPT® 76857) is the diagnostic procedure of choice for the initial evaluation of suspected adenomyosis. Duplex Doppler (CPT® 93975 or CPT® 93976) can be added if requested.  
* MRI Pelvis without contrast (CPT® 72195) or MRI Pelvis without and with contrast (CPT® 72197) is considered a second-line imaging option after transvaginal ultrasound if:  
  - Diagnosis is inconclusive for adenomyosis after an ultrasound and further delineation would affect management  
  - MRI needed to guide the treatment of adenomyosis in an individual with an enlarged uterus, and coexisting leiomyoma/fibroid following indeterminate ultrasound  

## Background and Supporting Information

Adenomyosis is when endometrial tissue, which normally lines the uterus, moves into the outer muscular walls of the uterus. Adenomyosis is a histologic diagnosis and is suspected by history and physical examination. Ultrasound findings of adenomyosis include heterogeneous myometrium, myometrial cysts, asymmetric myometrial thickness, and subendometrial echogenic linear striations.

## Evidence Discussion (PV-4.1)

* Transabdominal pelvic and/or transvaginal pelvic ultrasound are widely accepted as the initial imaging modality of choice for evaluation of adenomyosis. Ultrasound also allows for real-time evaluation with color and power Doppler which can help identify vascular flow and distinguish fluid and cysts from soft tissue. In the presence of features mimicking leiomyomas, Doppler US displaying vessels perpendicular to the endometrial interface, is suggestive of adenomyosis. Transvaginal ultrasound has a sensitivity of 83.8% and specificity of 63.9% for adenomyosis. The overall diagnostic accuracy of the use of transvaginal ultrasound with color Doppler for adenomyosis is 93.8%. Additional benefits to ultrasound as a first line imaging modality include wide availability, fast access, and lack of ionizing radiation exposure.  
* MRI of the pelvis is a second-line examination in the diagnosis of adenomyosis, mainly after an inconclusive US evaluation. MRI pelvis is useful in individuals with coexisting leiomyoma. A meta-analysis comparing the diagnostic performance of MRI and transvaginal ultrasound reported that MRI had a pooled sensitivity of 77% and
