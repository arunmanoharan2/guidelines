Musculoskeletal Imaging Guidelines    V2.0.2025

# General Guidelines (MS-1.0)

**MS.GG.0001.0.A**  
*v2.0.2025*

* Before advanced diagnostic imaging can be considered, there must be an in-person clinical evaluation as well as a clinical re-evaluation after a trial of failed conservative treatment; the clinical re-evaluation may consist of an in-person evaluation or other meaningful contact with the provider's office such as email, web, telephone communications, or clinical documentation from a provider.
* An in-person clinical evaluation for the current episode of the condition is required to have been performed before advanced imaging can be considered. This may have been either the initial clinical evaluation or the clinical re-evaluation.
* The in-person clinical evaluation should include a relevant history and physical examination, appropriate laboratory studies, and non-advanced imaging modalities. Other forms of meaningful contact (e.g., telephone call, electronic mail, telemedicine, or messaging) are not acceptable as an in-person evaluation.
* Prior to advanced imaging consideration, the results of plain x-rays performed after the current episode of symptoms started or changed need to be available to the requesting provider of the advanced imaging study for all musculoskeletal conditions, unless otherwise noted in the guidelines.
  - Initial plain x-ray can rule out those situations that do not often require advanced imaging, such as osteoarthritis, acute/healing fracture, dislocation, osteomyelitis, acquired/congenital deformities, and tumors of bone amenable to biopsy or radiation therapy (in known metastatic disease), etc.
  - X-ray may provide complementary clinical information regarding detailed bony anatomy, and may assist with preoperative planning when surgery is being contemplated.
  - X-ray may provide clinically significant details for soft tissue masses, such as soft tissue calcification, presence or absence of phleboliths, radiographic density, and effect on adjacent bone.
  - X-ray often has a larger field of view than MRI or CT and has the potential to identify more proximal or distal pathology in an extremity.
* Clinical re-evaluation is required prior to consideration of advanced diagnostic imaging to document failure of significant clinical improvement following a recent (within 12 weeks) six week trial of provider-directed conservative treatment. Clinical re-evaluation can include documentation of an in-person encounter with a provider or documentation of other meaningful contact with a provider’s office by the individual (e.g. telephone call, electronic mail, telemedicine, or messaging).
* Provider-directed conservative treatment may include rest, ice, compression, and elevation (R.I.C.E.), non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), narcotic

and non-narcotic analgesic medications, oral or injectable corticosteroids, viscosupplementation injections, a provider-directed home exercise program, cross-training, and/or physical/occupational therapy or immobilization by splinting/casting/bracing.  
* Orthopedic specialist evaluation can be helpful in determining the need for advanced imaging.  
  - The need for repeat advanced imaging should be carefully considered and may not be indicated if prior imaging has been performed.  
  - Serial advanced imaging, whether CT or MRI, for surveillance of healing or recovery from musculoskeletal disease is not supported by the medical evidence in the majority of musculoskeletal conditions.

## Evidence Discussion (MS-1)  
For most patients with a musculoskeletal complaint, a diagnosis can be made based on a detailed history, physical examination and plain radiographs.  

X-rays can determine whether an advanced diagnostic imaging study is actually needed, what specific advanced diagnostic imaging study is warranted and if contrast is needed. X-rays often have a larger field-of-view than an MRI or CT and have the potential to identify more proximal or distal pathology in an extremity that could ultimately assist in determining the patient's diagnosis. Advanced imaging results are better interpreted when compared to plain x-rays, which provide complementary clinical information regarding detailed bony anatomy and may assist with pre-operative planning when surgery is being contemplated. Taljanovic, et al. concluded when MRI is necessary, radiographs are considered an essential, initial complementary study for the reading of musculoskeletal MRIs. Initial plain x-rays (prior to obtaining advanced imaging) for musculoskeletal conditions are also recommended by the American College of Radiology Appropriate Use Criteria.  

Advanced imaging is typically not necessary for the initial evaluation for patients with a musculoskeletal complaint. Treatment for many musculoskeletal conditions does not rely on advanced imaging results and most patients will improve within a few weeks or months with conservative care. Advanced imaging can often demonstrate abnormalities that have no relevance to the patient's symptoms. It has been reported that approximately 30 – 40 percent of middle-aged patients and an even higher percentage of older patients have asymptomatic meniscus, rotator cuff and superior labral tears. Advanced imaging incidental findings can possibly lead to overtreatment with referral to specialists and possibly unnecessary surgery. Additional risks to the patient associated with advanced imaging include but are not limited to radiation exposure, implanted device complications, metallic foreign body complications and contrast complications.

Musculoskeletal Imaging Guidelines    V2.0.2025

In general, initial plain x-rays and an initial course of conservative care can provide a significant clinical benefit that would outweigh the clinical harm from perhaps briefly delaying advanced imaging if needed. A course of conservative care or plain x-ray findings many times may obviate the need for advanced imaging which possess their own set of significant risks.

Musculoskeletal Imaging Guidelines    V2.0.2025

# Plain X-Ray (MS-2.1)

**MS.IM.0002.1.A**  
**v2.0.2025**

* The results of plain x-rays performed after the current episode of symptoms started or changed need to be available to the requesting provider of the advanced imaging study for all musculoskeletal conditions, unless otherwise noted in the guidelines, to rule out those situations that do not often require advanced imaging, such as: osteoarthritis, acute/healing fracture, dislocation, osteomyelitis, acquired/congenital deformities, and tumors of bone amenable to biopsy or radiation therapy (in known metastatic disease), etc.

Musculoskeletal Imaging Guidelines    V2.0.2025

# MRI or CT (MS-2.2)

**MS.IM.0002.2.A**  
**v2.0.2025**

* Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is often the preferred advanced imaging modality in musculoskeletal conditions because it is superior in imaging the soft tissues and can also define physiological processes in some instances [e.g. edema, loss of circulation (AVN), and increased vascularity (tumors)].
* Computed Tomography (CT) is preferred for imaging cortical bone anatomy; thus, it is useful for studying complex fractures (particularly of the joints), dislocations, and assessing delayed union or non-union of fractures, if plain X-rays are equivocal. CT may be the procedure of choice in individuals who cannot undergo an MRI, such as those with pacemakers.

## Positional MRI
* Positional MRI is also referred to as dynamic, standing, weight-bearing, or kinetic MRI. Currently, there is inadequate scientific evidence to support the medical necessity of this study. As such, it should be considered not medically necessary.

## Positional CT
* Positional CT, also referred to as weight-bearing or cone beam CT, may be useful in imaging of the foot and ankle.  
  - If a request for foot or ankle imaging with positional CT meets medical necessity criteria for standard CT imaging (as defined in the condition-specific guidelines), the request may be approved.  
    * Positional CT of anatomic areas other than the foot and ankle are considered not medically necessary.

## dGEMRIC Evaluation of Cartilage
* Delayed gadolinium enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Cartilage (dGEMRIC) is a technique where an MRI estimates joint cartilage glycosaminoglycan content after penetration of the contrast agent in order to detect cartilage breakdown. Currently, there is inadequate scientific evidence to support the medical necessity of this study. As such, it should be considered not medically necessary for the diagnosis and surveillance of, or preoperative planning related to chondral pathology.

# Ultrasound (MS-2.3)

**MS.IM.0002.3.A**  
**v2.0.2025**

* Ultrasound (US) uses sound waves to produce images that can be used to evaluate a variety of musculoskeletal disorders. As with US in general, musculoskeletal US is highly operator-dependent, and proper training and experience are required to perform consistent, high-quality evaluations.

Musculoskeletal Imaging Guidelines    V2.0.2025

# Contrast Issues (MS-2.4)

**MS.IM.0002.4.A**  
**v2.0.2025**

* Most musculoskeletal imaging (MRI or CT) is without contrast; however, the following examples may be considered with contrast:  
  - Tumors, osteomyelitis, and soft tissue infection (without and with contrast)  
  - MRI arthrography (with contrast only)  
  - MRI for rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory arthritis (contrast as requested)  
  - For individuals with a contrast contraindication, if the advanced imaging recommendation specifically includes contrast, the corresponding advanced imaging study without contrast may be approved as an alternative, although the non-contrast study may not provide an adequate evaluation of the condition of concern.

Musculoskeletal Imaging Guidelines    V2.0.2025

# Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT) (MS-2.5)

**MS.IM.0002.5.A**  
**v2.0.2025**

* PET/CT is a nuclear medicine/computed tomography (CT) fusion study that uses a positron emitting radiotracer to create cross-sectional and volumetric images based on tissue metabolism. PET imaging fusion with CT allows for better anatomic localization of the areas of abnormal increased tissue activity seen on PET.  
* PET/CT is indicated for imaging of certain musculoskeletal conditions when MRI or CT is equivocal or cannot be performed. See: **Nuclear Medicine (MS-28)** for specific indications.  
  - At this time, FDG is the only indicated radiotracer for use with PET/CT in the imaging of musculoskeletal conditions.

Musculoskeletal Imaging Guidelines    V2.0.2025

# Nuclear Medicine (MS-2.6)

**MS.IM.0002.6.A**  
**v2.0.2025**

* A bone scan is a nuclear medicine imaging study in which an amount of radioactive material is injected and images are obtained at different time intervals, depending on the condition. A bone scan is done to reveal problems with bone metabolism. Areas where bone cells are repairing themselves show the most activity. It can help diagnose a number of bone conditions, including cancer of the bone or metastasis, location of bone inflammation, fracture, and bone infection.
* Nuclear Medicine WBC Scan is performed using radioactive material which is tagged to the white blood cells. When injected into the body, the material attaches to sites of inflammation/infection. Once distributed in these areas, the sites of suspected infection/inflammation can be seen on nuclear imaging equipment. These can be imaged as a planar study, SPECT study, or SPECT/CT study.
* Bone Marrow Imaging is used in combination with a WBC Scan to help differentiate between true infection and physiological marrow uptake. The bone marrow scan provides a map of the normal physiological white cell uptake that is then compared to the white blood cell scan. Any discordance in white cell uptake (e.g., more WBC uptake than marrow uptake) between the two studies indicates a focus of infection.
* See: **Nuclear Medicine (MS-28)** and condition-specific guidelines for specific indications.

Musculoskeletal Imaging Guidelines    V2.0.2025

# Evidence Discussion (MS-2)  
**v2.0.2025**

MRI is an excellent advanced imaging modality for musculoskeletal conditions. It is highly sensitive and specific for evaluation of soft tissue secondary to its superior soft tissue contrast resolution. It is highly sensitive for detection of occult fractures. MRI also carries the benefit of no ionizing radiation exposure. MRI is limited by its longer acquisition times, limited availability, distortion artifacts and incompatibility with some implantable devices and metallic objects. There is lack of high level evidence to support positional MRI.

Currently, there is inadequate high level scientific evidence to support the medical necessity of delayed gadolinium enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Cartilage (dGEMRIC). As such, it should be considered not medically necessary for the diagnosis and surveillance of, or preoperative planning related to chondral pathology.

CT is preferred for the evaluation of cortical bone anatomy. CT has the advantage of being widely available, especially in acute care settings. CT does carry the risk of ionizing radiation and it is estimated that 2% of all cancers in the United States may be attributable to radiation exposure from CT scans. Positional CT has been shown to be useful in the evaluation of foot and ankle conditions, however, there is there is insufficient evidence to support the use of positional CT for other anatomic areas.

FDG-PET/CT scan is highly sensitive (81-100%) and specific (87-100%) for the detection of osteomyelitis. However, FDG is the only indicated radiotracer for use with PET/CT in the imaging of musculoskeletal conditions.

Musculoskeletal Imaging Guidelines    V2.0.2025

# 3D Rendering (MS-3)

**MS.TD.0003.A**  
**v2.0.2025**

* Indications for musculoskeletal 3-D image post-processing for preoperative planning when conventional imaging is insufficient for:  
  - Complex fractures (comminuted or displaced)/dislocations of any joint.  
  - Spine fractures, pelvic/acetabulum fractures, intra-articular fractures.  
  - Preoperative planning for other complex surgical cases.  
* The code assignment for 3-D rendering depends upon whether the 3-D post-processing is performed on the scanner workstation (CPT® 76376) or on an independent workstation (CPT® 76377).  
  - 2-D reconstruction (i.e. reformatting axial images into the coronal plane) is considered part of the tomography procedure, is not separately reportable, and does not meet the definition of 3-D rendering.  
  - It is not indicated to report 3-D rendering in conjunction with CTA and MRA because those procedure codes already include the post-processing.  
  - In addition to the term "3-D," the following terms may also be used to describe 3-D post-processing:  
    * Maximum intensity projection (MIP)  
    * Shaded surface rendering  
    * Volume rendering  
* Additionally - If multiple CPT codes are performed for the same indication on the same day, one 3D rendering code is required. If they are performed on separate days, 3D rendering codes are required for each study on each day.  
* The 3-D rendering codes require concurrent supervision of image post-processing 3-D manipulation of volumetric data set and image rendering.  

## Evidence Discussion (MS-3)

3D CT improves both the reliability and the accuracy of radiographic characterization of articular fractures of the distal radius and influences treatment decisions, compared to 2D imaging alone. 3D reconstructions can be particularly helpful in preoperative planning for complex articular injuries. The addition of 3D reconstructions to standard 2D CT images has been shown to change operative management in up to 48% of intra-articular distal radius fractures.

In the evaluation of traumatic elbow injuries, 3D CT reconstruction of coronoid and olecranon fractures can identify specific shapes, sizes, and orientations of fracture fragments associated with various patterns of traumatic elbow instability which can impact surgical treatment planning.

Musculoskeletal Imaging Guidelines    V2.0.2025

In shoulder trauma, 3D CT images may better characterize fracture patterns and humeral neck angulation, which can affect functional outcomes. 3D CT images can better visualize scapula fracture displacement and angulation.

Pelvic and acetabular fractures can be difficult to appreciate on routine radiographs. Complex injuries and subtle fractures, especially in the axial plane, can be better demonstrated on 3D CT images.

For the assessment of postoperative alignment in trauma patients with ankle pilon fractures, studies have found 3D reconstruction with MRI to be comparable to that of 3D CT reconstructions. Evaluations of complex trauma, articular surfaces, and osseous alignment are potential indications in ankle imaging that may benefit from 3D reconstruction.

In a study of 35 patients with multiple rib fractures requiring surgical stabilization, imaging with 3D CT in addition to 2D CT and plain radiography changed the surgical plan in 65.7% of the cases, compared to imaging with plain radiography and 2D CT alone.
