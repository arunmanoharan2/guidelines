# General Guidelines (Neck-1.0)

**NK.GG.0001.0.A**  
**v1.0.2025**

* A pertinent clinical evaluation since the onset or change in symptoms including a detailed history, physical examination, appropriate laboratory studies, and basic imaging such as plain radiography or ultrasound should be performed prior to considering advanced imaging (CT, MR, Nuclear Medicine), unless the individual is undergoing guideline-supported scheduled imaging evaluation. A meaningful technological contact (telehealth visit, telephone call, electronic mail or messaging) since the onset or change in symptoms can serve as a pertinent clinical evaluation.

* Advanced imaging of the neck covers the following areas:  
  - Skull base (thus, a separate CPT® code for head imaging in order to visualize the skull base is not necessary)  
  - Nasopharynx  
  - Upper oral cavity to the head of the clavicle  
  - Parotid glands and the supraclavicular region

* Ultrasound of neck soft tissues including thyroid, parathyroid, parotid and other salivary glands, lymph nodes, cysts, etc. is coded as CPT® 76536. This can be helpful in more ill-defined masses or fullness and differentiating adenopathy from mass or cyst, to define further advanced imaging.

* CT Neck  
  - CT Neck is usually obtained with contrast only (CPT® 70491).  
    * With the exception of 4D CT Neck without and with contrast (CPT® 70492) for parathyroid adenoma localization, little significant information is added by performing a CT Neck without and with contrast (CPT® 70492), and there is the risk of added radiation exposure, especially to the thyroid.  
    * CT Neck without contrast (CPT® 70490) can be difficult to interpret due to difficulty identifying the blood vessels.  
      - Exceptions include:  
        * Contrast is generally not required when evaluating known or suspected tracheal anomalies with CT.  
        * Additionally, non-contrast CT may be supported for the evaluation of salivary duct stones in the appropriate clinical circumstance where intravenous contrast may obscure high attenuation stones. Dual-phase CT imaging (without and with IV contrast) is not supported in this situation.  
    * Contrast enhanced CT is helpful in the assessment of cervical adenopathy and preoperative planning, including in the setting of thyroid carcinomas.



---


- Contrast may cause intense and prolonged enhancement of the thyroid gland which interferes with radioactive iodine nuclear medicine studies.  
- Use of IV contrast is an important adjunct, however, because it helps to delineate the anatomic relationship between the primary tumor and metastatic disease. Iodine is generally cleared within four to eight weeks in most individuals, so concern about iodine burden from IV contrast causing a clinically significant delay in subsequent whole-body scans (WBSs) or radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment after the imaging followed by surgery is generally unfounded. The benefit gained from improved anatomic imaging generally outweighs any potential risk of a several week delay in RAI imaging or therapy. Where there is concern, a urinary iodine to creatinine ratio can be measured.

* MRI Neck  
  - MRI Neck is used less frequently than CT Neck.  
  - MRI Neck without and with contrast (CPT® 70543) is appropriate if CT suggests the need for further imaging or if ultrasound or CT suggests any of the following:  
    * Neurogenic tumor (schwannoma, neurofibroma, glomus tumor, etc.)  
    * Vascular malformations  
    * Deep neck masses  
    * Angiofibromas  
    * Cystic neck mass[^5]  
    * Concern for malignancy (see **Squamous Cell Carcinomas of the Head and Neck (ONC-3)**, **Salivary Gland Cancers (ONC-4)**, or **Thyroid Cancer (ONC-6)** as appropriate)  
  - MRI Neck without and with contrast (CPT® 70543) is also directly supported if the head and neck surgeon or neurosurgeon, or the provider in consultation with the head and neck surgeon or neurosurgeon, has reasonable clinical concern:  
    * for a skull base or nasopharyngeal neoplasm, or potential perineural invasion/cranial nerve involvement.[^2]  
    * that extensive dental amalgam may obscure the anatomy on CT in individuals with oral cavity neoplasm.

# Dysphagia and Upper Digestive Tract Disorders (Neck-3.1)

**NK.ED.0003.1.A**  
*v1.0.2025*

* **General considerations**  
  - A detailed history of the dysphagia symptoms is important to distinguish neurogenic, pharyngeal and esophageal disorders.  
  - Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) can be the result of a wide range of benign and malignant processes that affects the body's ability to move food or liquid from the mouth to the pharynx and into the esophagus.  
  - A short duration (weeks to months) of rapidly progressive esophageal dysphagia with associated weight loss is highly suggestive of esophageal cancer.  
  - Advanced imaging for individuals presenting with isolated globus rarely impacts clinical management. In a study of 148 neck CTs and 104 barium esophagrams done for the evaluation of globus sensation, there were no malignancies detected. [19]

* **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)** [5,14]  
  - Advanced imaging is generally not indicated for the evaluation of GERD, the diagnosis of which is usually made on the basis of clinical history, in conjunction with endoscopy, pH monitoring, Upper GI Barium Studies, and occasionally manometry. Exceptions would include the following:  
    - Non-cardiac chest pain suspected of being GERD should be evaluated first to exclude cardiac and other etiologies. See **Non-Cardiac Chest Pain-Imaging (CH-4.1)** in the Chest Imaging Guidelines.  
    - Gastric emptying study (CPT® 78264) for individuals with refractory GERD symptoms, and gastroparesis is being considered.

* **Suspected foreign body impaction and ingested foreign bodies** [1-3]  
  - Plain x-rays initial imaging.  
  - If imaging is inconclusive, and there is suspicion of a radiolucent foreign body (such as fish or chicken bones, wood, plastic, thin metal objects, aluminum can pop-ups, etc.): [18]  
    - CT Neck and/or Chest with or without contrast  
    - 3-D reconstruction (CPT® 76377 or CPT® 76376) is indicated in this setting.  
  - The use of oral contrast is discouraged (to avoid the aspiration of contrast material) for acute dysphagia or foreign body impaction, as the contrast may not pass, may be aspirated, and can interfere with subsequent endoscopic intervention.

* **Oropharyngeal dysphagia** [4,10,11]



---


* Oropharyngeal dysphagia (difficulty in transferring food from the mouth to the pharynx)  
  - Suspected neurologic causes: See appropriate sections in **Head Imaging Guidelines**.  
  - Initial evaluation is with direct visualization with laryngoscopy and/or upper endoscopy and a swallow study.  
    - Video fluoroscopic swallowing study – (Dynamic radiographic evaluation of swallowing during speech pathologist-guided oral intake of various consistencies)  
    - Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy and/or FEES (Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing. FEES is a dynamic evaluation of swallowing via direct visualization using transnasal laryngoscopy during speech pathologist-guided oral intake of various consistencies.  
  - CT Neck with contrast (CPT® 70491) is indicated for any documented anatomic abnormalities suggested by direct visualization—ie, on exam with flexible laryngoscopy or rigid video stroboscopy or FEES.  
    - Completion of a radiographic swallow study, though potentially helpful, is NOT necessary prior to the requested advanced imaging in such a case.

* **Esophageal dysphagia** 4,6,10,11  
  - Esophageal dysphagia (difficulty in transferring food down the esophagus in the retrosternal region, e.g., food sticking in the neck or chest)  
    - Initial evaluation is with barium esophagram or upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.  
    - Esophageal manometry if indicated, though not required.  
    - Advanced imaging is supported for the evaluation of structural abnormalities demonstrated on either esophagram or direct visualization (i.e., laryngoscopy/upper GI endoscopy), such as an external compression, tumor, stricture, diverticulum, etc.  
      - Contrasted CT Neck (CPT® 70491), CT Chest (CPT® 71260), **and/or** CT Abdomen (CPT® 74160) depending on the location of the abnormality identified.

* **Suspected perforation, abscess, or fistula**  
  - CT Neck, Chest, **and/or** Abdomen, contrast as requested (preferably with contrast- CPT® 70491, CPT® 71260, CPT® 74160), depending on location.

* **Hiatal hernia**  
  - See **Hiatal Hernia (AB-12.3)** in the Abdomen Imaging Guidelines.

* **Globus sensation** 7-9, 19  
  - Globus sensation is a feeling of a lump or foreign body in the throat. In general, laryngoscopy, endoscopy, and physical examination will rule out malignant causes.



---


and advanced imaging is usually not needed for evaluation. It is considered a mild form of dysphagia.  
* Direct visualization with laryngoscopy and/or upper endoscopy should be performed prior to advanced imaging.  
  - Unremarkable laryngoscopy and/or upper endoscopy does not preclude advanced imaging if **red flag** symptoms are also present:  
    * weight loss  
    * odynophagia/throat pain  
    * referred otalgia  
    * hoarseness  
    * hemoptysis, **AND/OR**  
    * other unilateral presentation of concerning symptoms.  
  - CT Neck with contrast (CPT® 70491) for ANY of the following:  
    * Negative or equivocal findings on laryngoscopy and/or upper endoscopy with any **red flag** present  
    * Known history of upper aerodigestive or esophageal malignancy  
    * Known history of lymphoma  
    * History of previous neck, esophageal, or gastric surgery—see below, and see **Background and Supporting Information** for post-operative oropharyngeal dysphagia associated with Anterior Cervical Spine Surgery (ACSS).  
    * Palpable abnormality on physical examination such as neck mass  

* **Post-operative dysphagia**  
  - Dysphagia following surgery on the oropharynx, soft tissues of the neck, cervical spine, esophagus, or stomach:  
    * In the immediate post-operative period, within 3 months of the surgery, the concern is for fluid collections, anastomotic leaks, perforations, and abscess. Prior laryngoscopy/upper endoscopy and barium esophagram are not required initially.  
      - CT Neck with contrast (CPT® 70491) **AND/OR** CT Chest with contrast (CPT® 71260)  
    * In the delayed post-operative period—three months or greater from surgery, the primary modalities for evaluation are history, physical, endoscopy (laryngoscopy or EGD) and/or barium esophagram/videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) to direct any additional advanced imaging.¹⁰,¹⁷ See also **Background and Supporting Information**.  
      - If the results of endoscopy and/or barium esophagram or VFSS are abnormal or inconclusive, the following is supported:  
        * CT Neck with contrast (CPT® 70491) **AND/OR** CT Chest with contrast (CPT® 71260)  


---


* **Suspected vascular ring** 8,9,12,13,15,16 (See **Dysphagia (PEDNECK-5)**)  
  - Advanced imaging can be performed if a vascular ring is suspected by, or in consultation with, the treating specialty, i.e., cardiothoracic surgery, cardiology, otolaryngology, and/or pulmonology. More commonly, this congenital pathology would be suspected in a much younger population, however, dysphagia lusoria is a relatively rare condition involving a vascular ring (usually an aberrant right subclavian artery). As children these individuals are asymptomatic but develop worsening dysphagia later in adulthood, presumably secondary to increasing calcification and blood pressure.  
    - CTA Chest (CPT® 71275) **OR** MRA Chest (CPT® 71555) are the preferred imaging studies in the evaluation of a suspected vascular ring.  
    - CT Chest with contrast (CPT® 71260) **OR** MRI Chest without contrast (CPT® 71550) **OR** MRI Chest without and with contrast (CPT® 71552) can be performed as alternative exams in the evaluation of suspected vascular ring.

**Background and Supporting Information**  
* Postoperative oropharyngeal dysphagia is one of the most common complications following anterior cervical spine surgery (ACSS), and is considered by some to be an inevitable result of this surgery, rather than a surgical complication.¹⁷  
* Severe dysphagia after ACSS should prompt immediate evaluation to exclude any potentially reversible surgical complication such as bone graft dislodgement, hematoma or retropharyngeal abscess.¹⁷  
* In general, history, exam, plain films, laryngoscopy, and videofluoroscopic swallow studies are considered the primary modalities for evaluation. The videofluoroscopic swallow study, in fact, is the gold standard in evaluation, and is very sensitive in patients post-ACSS, and should be considered the initial evaluation in patients who are status post ACSS with globus sensation, or mild dysphagia.¹⁷

**Evidence Discussion**  
**Dysphagia**  
* Imaging studies are complementary to endoscopy (and in certain cases, also manometry) in the evaluation of dysphagia. The optimal imaging study depends on the nature and location of the dysphagia, as well as clinical setting. Fluoroscopy, however, is usually the first line choice.  
* Modified barium swallow study (videofluoroscopic procedure performed in conjunction with a speech therapist) is generally first line for oropharyngeal dysphagia. CT is generally not indicated because it does not assess motility, nor the oropharyngeal and esophageal mucosa as well. CT may be helpful if subsequent evaluation if initial studies are not revealing, or if there are suspicious findings.



---


* Barium esophagram is generally first line for retrosternal dysphagia. CT is generally not indicated because it does not assess motility, nor esophageal mucosa as well. CT may be helpful if subsequent evaluation if initial studies are not revealing, or if there are suspicious findings.
* Fluoroscopy still remains the imaging of choice for initial evaluation of early (as well as late) post-operative dysphagia, within the oropharyngeal or retrosternal regions. Utilizing a water-soluble contrast first, followed by barium if necessary, suspected leaks or fistulas may be investigated. Esophagrams are highly specific for leaks, but not as sensitive as CT. If high clinical suspicion remains following negative esophagram, esophagography and CT combined have a sensitivity and negative predictive value of 100%, but a specificity of 27% and positive predictive value of 56%.
* For oropharyngeal and retrosternal dysphagia, contrasted CT of the neck and/or chest is indicated when there is concern of early post-operative complications, such as leak, fluid collection, abscess, or hematoma.

**NK.NM.0005.1.A**  
*v1.0.2025*

* Cervical lymphadenitis is common and follows most viral or bacterial infections of the ears, nose and throat.

* CT suggests the need for further imaging²  
* Ultrasound or CT suggests neurogenic tumor (schwannoma, neurofibroma, glomus tumor, etc.), vascular malformations, cystic neck mass⁷,⁹, deep neck masses², or angiofibroma².  
* MRI Orbit/Face/Neck without and with contrast (CPT® 70543) is also directly supported without prior CT Neck or ultrasound requirement, if the head and neck specialist, or the provider in consultation with the head and neck specialist, has reasonable clinical concern for:  
  - skull base or nasopharyngeal neoplasm, **OR**  
  - potential perineural invasion/cranial nerve involvement, **AND/OR**  
  - extensive dental amalgam which may obscure the anatomy on CT in individuals with oral cavity neoplasm.  

## Background and Supporting Information  
* Inflammatory neck adenopathy is often associated with upper respiratory infection, pharyngitis, dental infection, HIV and toxoplasmosis. Occasionally it is associated with sarcoidosis and tuberculosis.  
* Malignancy is a greater possibility in adults that are heavy drinkers and smokers, but HPV associated disease is on the rise and there can be a high suspicion for malignancy even without these traditional risk factors.  
* ENT evaluation can be helpful in determining the need for advanced imaging.  
* Although CT and MRI can have characteristic appearances for certain entities, biopsy and histological diagnosis are the only way to obtain a definitive diagnosis. The preferred initial method of biopsy is Ultrasound guided core needle biopsy of the mass.⁵,⁶  
* The most common causes of neoplastic cervical adenopathy are metastasis from head and neck tumors or lymphoma.  
* Tonsil asymmetry is a common exam finding in both adults and children and is often benign. In cases of associated suspicious characteristics, neck imaging is supported, even if there is not an associated neck mass.¹¹-¹³  
* MRI has great specificity for determining the boundaries and prevalence of developmental neck cysts. It may thus be considered optimal to use only MRI, which leads to a correct diagnosis in more than 90% of cases.⁹  

## Evidence Discussion  
* CT has several benefits that support its utilization as a primary imaging modality, including its availability and cost. CT imaging is generally easily tolerated by patients because of short scanning time (<5 minutes) and large scanner bore. While CT utilizes ionizing radiation, the average dose of 3 mSv (equivalent to approximately 150 chest x-rays) is considered acceptable in the adult population.  


---


* MRI is preferred for tumors of the nasopharynx or when there is a cranial nerve concern on physical examination because of its sensitivity to abnormalities of the skull base and in the detection of perineural spread. MRI also offers improved tissue contrast and can help detect subclinical tumors not evident with nasal endoscopy.
* Ultrasound is also used to characterize neck masses, to guide tissue sampling, and to search for additional masses. It is both noninvasive and inexpensive. Ultrasound is, however, best suited for evaluation of superficial tissue, in situations where there will be a delay in obtaining CT or MRI, if the use of contrast medium is contraindicated, or as an adjunct to expedite FNA biopsy.

# Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Palsy (Neck-7.1)

**NK.PA.0007.1.A**  
**v1.0.2025**

* The following are supported with new diagnosis[^6] of idiopathic unilateral vocal fold paralysis/immobility or weakness, as identified on videostroboscopy or laryngoscopy by an Otolaryngologist—Head and Neck surgeon, or a clinician in consultation with such a specialist: [^1,^4,^8,^9]  
  - MRI Brain without and with contrast (CPT® 70553) **OR** MRI Brain without contrast (CPT® 70551)  
    **AND**  
  - MRI Orbit/Face/Neck with and without contrast (CPT® 70543) **OR** CT Neck with contrast (CPT® 70491)  
    **AND**  
  - CT Chest with contrast (CPT® 71260) (Strongly recommended for left vocal fold paralysis and may be indicated for right vocal fold paralysis. If requested, see **Background and Supporting Information**.) [^1^-^4,^7^-^10]

## Background and Supporting Information [^1^-^10]

* The right and left recurrent laryngeal nerves supply the motor innervation of the right and left vocal folds/cords, respectively. They are branches off of the Vagus Nerve, CN X. The entire pathway from origin to endpoint of this nerve must be visualized in cases of presumed idiopathic vocal fold paralysis, newly identified by laryngoscopy, to search for a possible cause. From the origin of the vagus at the medulla oblongata to the looping down into the superior mediastinum and back to the neck of its branching nerve (the recurrent laryngeal nerve)—advanced imaging is required to screen for a cause for otherwise idiopathic vocal fold paralysis/paresis. The greater the degree of motion impairment, the more likely it is to find a cause on imaging.  
* The superior mediastinum is most noteworthy for containing the take-off point of the three great branches of the aortic arch: the brachiocephalic trunk (also known as the innominate artery), the left common carotid artery, and the left subclavian artery.  
* The extent of the CT Neck with contrast, to be inclusive of the entirety of the course of the recurrent laryngeal nerve in question, would have to extend to the "thoracic inlet" portion of the superior mediastinum on the right, and the "aortic triangle" portion of the superior mediastinum on the left.  
* Contrasted CT Chest is strongly supported with left vocal cord palsy due to the lower course of the recurrent laryngeal nerve branch on the left side of the body. It curves

inferior to the aortic arch and ascends in the groove between the trachea and the esophagus. However, the course of the recurrent laryngeal nerve on the right side may be as low as the level at which the brachiocephalic artery meets the subclavian artery, and this area of the thoracic inlet may or may not be contained within the anatomic extent of a CT neck at all institutions.  
* Repeat imaging for a pre-existing diagnosis of idiopathic unilateral vocal cord paralysis may be considered on a case by case basis. Recommendations include possibly repeating advanced imaging as above within 5 years after initial diagnosis and workup, or performing regular (annual) clinical evaluations with imaging reserved for the development of new symptoms or exam findings.⁶

**Evidence Discussion**  
**Evaluation of Idiopathic Unilateral Vocal Fold Paralysis/Immobility**  
* Idiopathic unilateral vocal fold immobility is a diagnosis of exclusion. When it is noted that a vocal cord is immobile on laryngoscopy, the etiology must be sought. If it is not apparent on history and laryngoscopy, this work-up involves imaging the entire pathway of the motor nerve supply to the involved side of the larynx—from the brain to the superior mediastinum.  
* Generally, CT imaging does not have a significant diagnostic yield in the evaluation of idiopathic unilateral vocal fold paralysis/immobility and otherwise unnecessarily exposes patients to radiation.

# Thyroid Nodule (Neck-8.1)

**NK.PT.0008.1.A**  
**v1.0.2025**

* **Serum thyrotropin (TSH)** should be measured in the initial evaluation of thyroid nodule/mass/asymmetry/goiter but is not required for follow-up imaging.¹³⁶⁷  
* **Ultrasound (US) Neck (CPT ® 76536)** is required as the initial study prior to any advanced imaging studies for evaluation of a palpable thyroid nodule/mass/asymmetry/goiter.³⁵  
  - Ultrasound is also indicated for nodules incidentally found on CT, MRI, or PET (focal activity).²³⁶  
* See **Thyroid Cancer-Surveillance/Follow-Up (ONC-6.4)** for thyroid nodules that are biopsy proven thyroid cancer but are being monitored on active surveillance.  
* A thyroid nodule detected for the first time during pregnancy should be managed in the same way as in non-pregnant individuals, except for avoiding the use of radioactive agents for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.³  
* **Nuclear scan (CPT ® 78013 or CPT ® 78014)** is indicated if the serum TSH is subnormal and ANY of the following:  
  - Single or multiple thyroid nodules¹³⁶⁷  
  - Suspicion of ectopic thyroid tissue³  
  - Presence of thyroid nodule in the setting of Grave’s disease³⁷  
* **Nuclear medicine thyroid scan (CPT ® 78013 or CPT ® 78014)** is considered for ANY of the following (TSH is not required prior to imaging in the below settings):  
  - Evaluate eligibility for radioiodine therapy³  
  - Select nodules to biopsy in multinodular goiter even if TSH not low¹⁶⁷  
  - Substernal goiter with compressive symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, stridor, cough, dysphonia, dysphagia)  
  - Non-diagnostic or indeterminate FNA of thyroid nodule (e.g., follicular lesion of undetermined significance), to see if hot (functioning) nodule that may be benign vs cold nodule  
* **CT Neck with contrast (CPT ® 70491), or CT Neck without contrast (CPT ® 70490), or MRI Orbit/Face/Neck without contrast (CPT ® 70540), or MRI Orbit/Face/Neck without and with contrast (CPT ® 70543):**  
  Imaging should be done only after initial thyroid ultrasound has been performed.³  
  MRI and CT **are not** indicated for routine thyroid nodule evaluation and should only be considered for:⁵  
  - evaluation of extent of known substernal goiter.³⁷  
  - suspected airway compression (i.e., subjective sense of dyspnea or choking sensation in the clinical history with known multinodular goiter).³⁷

* presence of pathologic lymph nodes in cervical regions not visualized on ultrasound.³  
* clinically suspected advanced thyroid disease, including invasive primary tumor.³,⁶,⁷  
* any preoperative planning for thyroid disease.³,⁵,⁹,¹⁰  

* **CT Chest without contrast (CPT ® 71250) or with contrast (CPT ® 71260)** is also indicated for:  
  - preoperative planning for individuals with substernal extension of the thyroid, pulmonary symptoms, or abnormalities on recent chest x-ray, and should be ordered by a surgeon or in consultation with a surgeon.¹⁰  

* **Thyroglossal duct cysts (TGDC)** are the most common type of congenital neck cyst of the midline neck, and may be first diagnosed in adulthood, though more commonly in early childhood.⁸,⁹  
  - A physical exam feature includes the rise and fall of the midline mass with protrusion and retraction of the tongue, due to its embryonal connection to the foramen cecum.⁸,⁹  
  - There is a small risk (about 1%) of incidental malignant degeneration within the TGDC, particularly within adults, and therefore, it is uniformly managed surgically. The Sistrunk procedure, which involves resection of the TGDC and its complete tract within the surrounding midline tissues—to include the middle third of the hyoid bone, is considered the gold standard in surgical management with a less than 5% risk of recurrence.⁸,⁹  
  - Advanced imaging, per surgeon's request—or a provider in consultation with the head and neck surgeon, to include Neck Ultrasound (CPT® 76536) **AND/OR** CT Neck with contrast (CPT® 70491) or MRI Neck with and without contrast (CPT® 70543), is generally supported pre-operatively, or for the evaluation of a suspected recurrence.⁸,⁹  

## Background and Supporting Information  
* The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Thyroid Imaging, Reporting, and Data System (TI-RADS), consisting of five levels, is utilized for recommendations in determining US follow-up vs FNA of thyroid nodule(s). TI-RADS levels are determined based on the ultrasound appearance of the nodule. Grading criteria are available at https://www.acr.org/-/media/ACR/Files/RADS/TIRADS/TI-RADS-chart.pdf?la=en.  
* The American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines from 2015 also use imaging characteristics and size for thyroid nodule risk stratification however size cutoffs are slightly more generous when compared to ACR-TIRADs. Sonographic imaging and/or biopsy requests in accordance with ATA criteria are appropriate.

* Fine-Needle Aspiration (FNA) biopsy is indicated for suspicious and/or large thyroid nodules prior to CT or MRI imaging.
* Ultrasound is not used to screen:  
  1) the general population,  
  2) individuals with normal thyroid on palpation with a low risk of thyroid cancer,  
  3) individuals with hyperthyroidism,  
  4) individuals with hypothyroidism, or  
  5) individuals with thyroiditis.  
  Conversely, US can be considered in individuals who have no symptoms but are high-risk as a result of: history of head and neck irradiation, total body irradiation for bone marrow transplant, exposure to fallout from radiation during childhood or adolescence, as well as family history of thyroid cancer syndromes such as MEN2, medullary or papillary thyroid cancer, Cowden’s disease, familial adenomatous polyposis, Carney complex, Werner syndrome/progeria.
* There is insufficient evidence supporting the use of PET to distinguish indeterminate thyroid nodules that are benign from those that are malignant.
* 18FDG-PET imaging is not routinely recommended for the evaluation of thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytology. Routine preoperative 18FDG-PET scanning is not recommended.
* Elastography provides information about nodule stiffness that is complementary to gray scale ultrasound findings in nodules with indeterminate cytology or ultrasound findings. It should not be used as a substitute for gray scale ultrasound.
* Use of ultrasound contrast medium is not recommended for the diagnostic evaluation of thyroid nodules and its current use is restricted to definition of size and limits of necrotic zones after minimally invasive nodule ablation techniques.

**Evidence Discussion**  
* Ultrasound (US) plays a key role in determining which nodules display characteristics suspicious for malignancy and warrant biopsy. Of palpable thyroid nodules, the American College of Radiology (ACR) states, "US provides high-resolution imaging to show that the palpable abnormality is within the thyroid and is the best study to characterize the nodule for the risk of malignancy". US is also the best study to demonstrate goiter size and evaluate thyroid morphology.
* Nuclear imaging with a radionuclide uptake and scan also plays an important role in thyroid imaging. In the setting of a suppressed thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level, nuclear imaging helps to determine whether the patient has thyrotoxicosis.
* A thyroid nuclear scan, in conjunction with thyroid ultrasound, is also useful in the setting of a multinodular goiter and a normal TSH to identify hypofunctioning or isofunctioning nodules which should be targeted for biopsy.



---


* Neck CT is useful in determining the extent of a substernal goiter, evaluating whether a goiter is causing tracheal compression or deviation, assessing the extent of invasive thyroid cancer, or for preoperative imaging. It does not have a role in distinguishing benign from malignant thyroid nodules.
* Neck CT is preferred to neck MRI, as there is less respiratory motion artifact.
* FDG-PET/CT does not have a role in the initial imaging of a thyroid nodule.

# Hyperthyroidism and Hypothyroidism (Neck-8.2)

**NK.PT.0008.2.A**  
*v1.0.2025*

* Hyperthyroidism suspected[^4]  
  - Thyroid Uptake Study (CPT® 78012 or CPT® 78014) if ONE of the following:  
    * TSH below normal range and elevated free T4 and/or free T3, OR  
    * Subclinical hyperthyroidism with TSH <0.1 mU/L and normal free T4 and free T3, OR  
    * Subclinical hyperthyroidism with TSH below the lower limit of normal but ≥0.1 and normal free T4 and free T3 in the setting of any of the following:  
      - Age **≥65**  
      - Symptoms of hyperthyroidism  
      - Presence of cardiac disease or osteoporosis  
  - Ultrasound (US) Neck (CPT® 76536) if any of the following:  
    * Palpable nodule on examination  
    * Nuclear scanning is suggestive of thyroid nodular disease  
    * Diagnostic uncertainty regarding the etiology of hyperthyroidism based on clinical presentation and initial biochemical evaluation  
    * To evaluate thyroid dimensions for planning RAI treatment  
    * Nuclear scanning is contraindicated (i.e., pregnancy, breastfeeding etc)  

* Hyperthyroidism on therapy — For individuals with thyroid hormone levels (TSH, free T4 and free T3) within the normal, hypothyroid, or hyperthyroid range while receiving treatment with an anti-thyroid medication (methimazole or propylthiouracil/PTU):  
  - Nuclear Scan (CPT® 78013 or CPT® 78014) if ONE of the following:  
    * To determine the cause of hyperthyroidism if there was no diagnostic scan prior to the start of medical therapy  
    * To characterize the uptake in a thyroid nodule(s) to properly triage the nodule for FNA if there was no diagnostic scan prior to the start of medical therapy  
  - Thyroid Uptake Study (CPT® 78012 or CPT® 78014) if:  
    * plan is for radioactive iodine therapy as definitive hyperthyroidism treatment.  

* Hypothyroidism: There is no role for thyroid imaging in the workup of hypothyroidism in adults. Imaging for thyroid morphology does not help differentiate among causes of hypothyroidism, and all causes of hypothyroidism will have decreased radioiodine uptake.



---


# Evidence Discussion

* The etiology of thyrotoxicosis is not always apparent in clinical presentation and therefore the use of diagnostic imaging studies is indicated to determine the etiology of hyperthyroidism.
* Thyroid nuclear scans play a central role in thyroid disease evaluation. They provide a planar image of the thyroid gland using a gamma camera to assess potential variability in the concentration of the radioisotope within thyroid tissue and can be combined with measurements of uptake of specific tracers and provide very useful information regarding thyroid pathology and function.
* Imaging with a radioiodine uptake and scan provides a valuable benefit as it can help confirm the cause for thyrotoxicosis and helps to decide the most appropriate treatment, which may vary depending on cause of hyperthyroidism.
* Imaging with a thyroid nuclear scan also has a role in planning therapy with radioactive iodine.
* Radioiodine uptake and scans can distinguish between high-uptake causes of thyrotoxicosis, such as Graves disease, toxic adenoma, and toxic multinodular goiter, and low-uptake causes, such as subacute thyroiditis.
* The scan component is helpful in differentiating between the high-uptake causes that show a focal uptake pattern, such as toxic adenoma or toxic multinodular goiter, and the high uptake causes that show a diffuse uptake pattern such as Graves disease.
* If radioiodine therapy is planned, the uptake component of the scan can then help determine the dose.
* A neck ultrasound is the best imaging study to evaluate thyroid morphology and can be a helpful adjunct study to a radioiodine uptake. Although a Doppler ultrasound may help to distinguish the cause of hyperthyroidism, a radionuclide uptake study is still preferred because it directly measures thyroid activity rather than inferring it based on blood flow.
* When a radioactive uptake scan shows nodules from toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma, a neck ultrasound can confirm presence of nodules and also evaluate for suspicious features of malignancy.
* Though radioactivity exposure exists with the use of radioactive scans, the studies are an invaluable resource when helping to establish the cause of hyperthyroidism and guide treatment; guidelines as to when it is appropriate to order should be followed to avoid unnecessary radiation exposure.
* There is no role for imaging in the workup of hypothyroidism in adults. Imaging for thyroid morphology does not help differentiate among causes of hypothyroidism, and all causes of hypothyroidism will have decreased radioiodine uptake.

* Primary hyperparathyroidism variants  
  - Primary hyperparathyroidism with non-elevated serum calcium (serum calcium level normal and PTH elevated)  
    * Confirmatory study is elevated ionized calcium, elevated albumin corrected calcium or elevated historic calcium levels.¹,⁴  
  - Hypercalcemia with inappropriately non-suppressed PTH (calcium level elevated and PTH normal)  
    * PTH level ≥25 pg/mL is consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism.  
    * See **Background and Supporting Information** for more information.  
  - Intention of parathyroid imaging should be for pre-operative localization.  
  - Use the same guidance on imaging modalities as described in “classic” primary hyperparathyroidism.

**Background and Supporting Information**

* Hypercalcemia in individuals with primary hyperparathyroidism may be determined by elevated serum calcium, elevated serum ionized calcium, elevated serum calcium level corrected for albumin, or historic calcium elevation. A comparison of serial measurements of calcium is helpful in determining the presence of true hypercalcemia as calcium levels may be variable over time.
* Parathyroidectomy candidacy should be determined by the provider, however national guidelines recognize the following criteria for surgery:¹,⁴
  - All individuals <50 years of age, regardless of whether objective features are present or absent


---


* All symptomatic individuals, including those with kidney stones, hypercalcemic crises, pathologic fractures or other associated symptoms  
* Individuals with findings concerning for parathyroid cancer (very high calcium >13)  
* All asymptomatic individuals with the following:  
  - Serum calcium >1.0 mg/dl (0.25 mmol/l) above the normal range  
  - BMD by DEXA: T-score ≤2.5 at the lumbar spine, total hip femoral neck or distal 1/3 radius (The forearm- i.e., distal 1/3 radius is preferentially impacted by primary hyperparathyroidism as this area is rich in cortical bone.)  
  - Vertebral fracture by x-ray, CT, MRI and vertebral fracture assessment  
  - Estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 ml/min  
  - Urinary calcium excretion >400 mg in 24 hours  
  - Nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis by x-ray, ultrasound or CT  
* Asymptomatic individuals who cannot participate in appropriate medical surveillance  
* Asymptomatic individuals desiring definitive surgical management  

* For cases of “normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism” in which primary hyperparathyroidism is not confirmed, additional investigation for secondary causes of hyperparathyroidism (renal insufficiency, hypercalciuria as a primary renal abnormality, vitamin D deficiency and gastrointestinal malabsorption problems such as short gut syndrome, celiac disease, Crohn's disease or a prior Roux-en-Y bypass surgery) is indicated.¹,¹⁸  
* For cases of hypercalcemia in which primary hyperparathyroidism is not confirmed, additional consideration for other causes of hypercalcemia (malignancy including PTH-RP mediated and myeloma, granulomatous disease, FHH, medications including thiazide diuretics, excessive calcium/vitamin D supplementation and the history of or present lithium use) is indicated.¹  

**Evidence Discussion**  
* The purpose of parathyroid imaging is to aid in localizing hyperfunctioning parathyroid gland(s) for the purpose of curative surgery. Imaging has no role in the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism.  
* There may be a need for more than one modality in the localization of a parathyroid adenoma as studies have shown because no one modality is superior over others,  
* The sensitivity and PPV of imaging modalities will vary in different situations, such as whether the patient has a single parathyroid adenoma or if multiple parathyroid glands are involved, if the imaging is for an initial surgical intervention versus a re-operation, and whether the patient has primary, secondary, or tertiary hyperparathyroidism.

# Parathyroid Incidentaloma (Neck-8.4)

**NK.PT.0008.4.A**  
**v1.0.2025**

* A mass incidentally found on neck imaging that may represent an enlarged parathyroid gland, should prompt laboratory testing including calcium and PTH levels.¹⁻⁵  
  - If laboratory abnormalities suggest hyperparathyroidism, i.e., "functioning parathyroid incidentaloma", see **Hyperparathyroidism (NECK- 8.3)** for imaging recommendations.  
  - If there are no laboratory abnormalities and diagnoses other than parathyroid incidentaloma are suspected, see **Neck Mass/Swelling/Adenopathy (NECK- 5.1)** for imaging recommendations.  
  - Parathyroid nuclear scans are commonly requested for an evaluation of a PTI however the sensitivity of these scans are low in individuals with normal calcium/PTH and no clinical symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism.⁵,⁶ Reliance on either a positive scan or negative scan to decide if surgery is indicated is not supported by current literature.  
* If a parathyroid incidentaloma is suspected on imaging prior to planned thyroid surgery or other head/neck surgery⁴, the following studies are indicated if ordered by the surgical team or any provider in consultation with the surgical team:  
  - Parathyroid Planar Imaging (CPT® 78070), Parathyroid Planar Imaging with SPECT (CPT® 78071), or Parathyroid Planar Imaging with SPECT/CT (CPT® 78072) AND/OR Ultrasound (CPT® 76536) AND/OR 4D CT Neck without and with contrast (CPT® 70492)  
* Ultrasound (US) Neck (CPT® 76536) is indicated annually if the mass was not removed surgically.³

## Background and Supporting Information

* "Parathyroid incidentalomas" include parathyroid adenomas found unexpectedly at the time of surgery or seen on ultrasound.¹⁻⁶  
* Normal sized parathyroid glands (~6mm) are not usually identified by most imaging modalities, so enlargement warrants laboratory evaluation to rule out pathologic causes such as primary hyperparathyroidism or rarely parathyroid carcinoma.¹⁻⁴  
* Sonographic imaging features of a parathyroid incidentaloma (ovoid, hypoechoic, well circumscribed and adjacent to but separate from the thyroid either posteriorly or inferiorly) may have overlap with perithyroidal lymph nodes and exophytic thyroid nodules in a multinodular goiter.¹⁻⁴  
* The literature does report cases of pathologically confirmed parathyroid adenomas/hyperplasia in individuals with normal serum calcium and PTH levels, so these

enlarged parathyroid glands, may represent an early stage of hyperparathyroidism.  
It is unclear what percentage of non-functioning PTIs become hyper-secreting over time, but many of these masses are surgically managed.²³⁴⁶  
* Normally sized and normally functioning parathyroid glands do not take up sestamibi or tetrofosmin.⁷ The likelihood of a positive parathyroid nuclear scan is low in the setting of normal calcium and PTH levels.⁵⁶  
* Parathyroid fine needle aspiration biopsy has been used historically however its diagnostic use is limited, due to the potential for hemorrhage and fibrosis which make eventual surgical dissection and pathologic interpretation more difficult.¹⁴  

**Evidence Discussion**  
* With the advent of high resolution CT scans, ultrasounds and other imaging modalities, along with their widespread use as diagnostic modalities, parathyroid lesions are increasingly being incidentally found on these imaging studies  
* The distinct features of parathyroid lesions are readily seen on ultrasound imaging  
* If lab work does not indicate hyperfunctioning of the parathyroid gland, then these lesions can be monitored annually with ultrasound as parathyroid nuclear scans have low sensitivity for detection in patients with normal parathyroid function.  
* Parathyroid nuclear scans, 4D CT of the Neck, and Neck ultrasound studies can be used in evaluation of parathyroid incidentalomas found prior to a pending neck surgery to aid in preoperative evaluation, as determined by the surgical team.

# Imaging of the Larynx, Trachea, and Bronchus (Neck-9.1)

**NK.TR.0009.1.A**  
**v1.0.2025**

* Initial evaluation for suspected laryngotracheal pathology:  
  - Direct visualization of the upper airway (via laryngoscopy, with or without bronchoscopy), and can also include  
  - Plain x-rays of the neck with or without chest x-ray  
* To further evaluate definite abnormalities found on either of the above, including laryngotracheal, tracheal, or bronchial anomalies, foreign bodies or persistent segmental or lobar lung collapse:  
  - CT Neck with contrast (CPT® 70491) **OR** CT Neck without contrast (CPT® 70490) **AND/OR**  
  - CT Chest with contrast (CPT® 71260) **OR** CT Chest without contrast (CPT® 71250), depending on the anatomic level of the lesion.  
    - See **Squamous Cell Carcinomas of the Head and Neck—Suspected/Diagnosis (ONC-3.1)** for suspected laryngotracheal tumor.  
* For suspected subglottic stenosis (SGS) after evaluation by a specialist or in consultation with a specialist who has directly visualized the upper airway:  
  - CT Neck with contrast (CPT® 70491) **OR** CT Neck without contrast (CPT® 70490) is supported.  
* For obstructive physiology in the setting of tracheomalacia:  
  - Expiratory HRCT (CPT® 71250) is supported.¹  

## Background and Supporting Information

* Bronchoscopy can further evaluate the distal endobronchial tree.  
* Suspected laryngotracheal disease can be identified by inspiratory or biphasic stridor and a characteristic flow-volume loop of PFTs.¹  
* The visualization of tracheal or bronchial "inspissation" or thickening of secretions without an abnormality, is not a risk for malignancy.³  
* CT with multiplanar reformatting has proven comparable to rigid bronchoscopy with a 100% sensitivity and specificity of detecting SGS and for measuring length and grade of stenosis.⁵  


---


# Evidence Discussion

* Radiographs by means of neck and chest radiographs are sensitive for only those radio opaque foreign bodies but have value in providing information regarding other chest pathology such as presence of consolidation, atelectasis and bronchiectasis.  
* CT is more sensitive than x ray in identifying airway foreign bodies due to its higher resolution.  
* CT scan can rapidly and accurately identify laryngo-tracheo-bronchial abnormalities prior to bronchoscopy such as pneumonia, airway stenosis, atelectasis, effusion and consolidation.  
* CT provides a sensitivity of more than 96% and a specificity of more than 97% in comparison to bronchoscopy for detecting tracheomalacia. CT provides the advantage of simultaneously evaluating mediastinal, vascular and lung pathologies.

# Neck Pain (Cervical) (Neck-10.1)

**NK.NP.0010.1.A**  
**v1.0.2025**

* Neck pain is usually related to a specific process including pharyngitis, radiculopathy, adenopathy, mass, carotid dissection and torticollis, and therefore found elsewhere in these guidelines.¹  
* For the evaluation of neck pain or other symptoms which may involve the cervical spine, including myelopathy and cervical radiculopathy,¹ see **Spine Imaging Guidelines**.


---


# Torticollis and Dystonia (Neck-10.2)

**NK.NP.0010.2.A**  
**v1.0.2025**

## Older Child (beyond infancy) or Adult[^1]

* To identify fracture or malalignment in cases of trauma:  
  - Initial evaluation with recent trauma (without a high-risk mechanism of injury–see **SP-3.2 Neck (Cervical Spine) Trauma**) is by plain radiographs of the cervical spine.  
    If inconclusive:  
    - CT Neck with contrast (CPT® 70491) **AND/OR**  
    - CT Cervical Spine without contrast (CPT® 72125)  
* In the clinical setting of cervical spine trauma with an associated neurologic deficit:  
  - MRI Cervical Spine without contrast (CPT® 72141) is supported.  
* To evaluate for soft tissue or neurological cause in cases with no trauma history:  
  - CT Neck with contrast (CPT® 70491), **AND/OR**  
  - MRI Cervical Spine without contrast (CPT® 72141), **OR**  
  - CT Cervical Spine without contrast (CPT® 72125)  
    - Positive → Further advanced imaging is not required if CT Neck or CT/MRI Cervical Spine has identified local cause.  
    - Negative → MRI Brain without and with contrast (CPT® 70553) to exclude CNS cause.  

## Evidence Discussion

* Plain radiography continues to be the primary imaging modality for the initial diagnosis of neck concerns in cases of trauma without high-risk mechanism of injury.  
* CT offers superior depiction of cortical bone and is more sensitive than radiographs in assessing facet degenerative disease, osteophyte formation, and other osseous structures.  
* Patients with abnormal neurological findings benefit from MRI to help identify spinal cord abnormalities and soft tissue causes in the workup of dystonia and/or torticollis.  
* Risks associated with imaging include but are not limited to radiation exposure and contrast complications.

# Eagle's Syndrome (Neck-10.3)

**NK.NP.0010.3.A**  
**v1.0.2025**

Also known as "calcified stylohyoid ligament", "elongation of styloid process", or "stylocarotid artery syndrome".

* **"Classic Eagle Syndrome"**  
  - Typically seen in individuals after pharyngeal trauma or tonsillectomy[^4,^5]  
  - Characterized by ipsilateral dull, persistent pharyngeal pain, centered in the ipsilateral tonsillar fossa, that can be referred to the ear, and exacerbated by rotation of the head  
  - Other symptoms may include dysphagia, sensation of foreign body in the throat, tinnitus, or cervicofacial pain.  
  - If Eagle Syndrome is suspected on exam and/or lateral neck x-ray:[^4,^5]  
    - CT Maxillofacial with contrast (CPT® 70487) **OR** CT Maxillofacial without contrast (CPT® 70486) **AND/OR**  
    - CT Neck with contrast (CPT® 70491) **OR** CT Neck without contrast (CPT® 70490)  

* **"Stylocarotid Artery Syndrome"** (i.e., the anterior circulation equivalent of "bow hunter syndrome"—rotational vertebral artery occlusion syndrome[^8,^9])  
  - It is characterized by the compression of the internal or external carotid artery (with their peri-vascular sympathetic fibers) by a laterally or medially deviated styloid process.  
  - It is related to a pain along the distribution of the artery, which is provoked and exacerbated by rotation and compression of the neck.  
  - It is not correlated with tonsillectomy.  
  - If Stylocarotid Artery Syndrome is suspected on exam and/or lateral neck x-ray:  
    - CT Maxillofacial with contrast (CPT® 70487) **AND/OR**  
    - CT Neck with contrast (CPT® 70491)  
    - Dynamic/Positional CTA (CPT® 70498) is also supported to assess for concerns of vascular compression (see also **General Guidelines - CT and MR Angiography (CTA and MRA) (HD-1.5)**[^9] and **General Guidelines - Other Imaging Situations (HD-1.7)**[^6])  
    - In cases of impingement of the internal carotid artery, there may be referred supraorbital pain and parietal headache. In cases of external carotid artery irritation, the pain radiates to the infraorbital region.  

* CT scanning (and in particular, 3-D CT scanning) represents an extremely valuable imaging tool in patients with Eagle syndrome. 3-D rendering (CPT® 76376 or CPT®

76377) is supported as an add on to CT Neck (CPT® 70491 or CPT® 70490), if requested, for accurate evaluation of the styloid process in relation to its anatomic relationship with the other head and neck structures, in surgical planning.7 See **3D Rendering (Preface-4.1)**.

**Background and Supporting Information**  
* Torticollis or cervical dystonia is an abnormal twisting of the neck resulting in head rotation. Its causes are many and may be congenital or acquired and caused by trauma, infection/inflammation, neoplasm and/or idiopathic. It occurs more frequently in children and on the right side (75%).  
* Eagle syndrome is characterized by recurrent pain in the oropharynx and face due to an elongated styloid process or calcified stylohyoid ligament. The styloid process is a slender outgrowth at the base of the temporal bone, immediately posterior to the mastoid apex.4,8

**Evidence Discussion**  
* If Eagle syndrome is suspected on exam and/or lateral neck xray, CT Maxillofacial or CT Neck are supported.4,7  
* CT is the preferred modality for evaluation of bony structures and detection of abnormalities associated with calcifications.  
* Indications for cervicocerebral computed tomography angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head and neck vessels or include the diagnosis, characterization and/or surveillance of a variety of vascular conditions, including vascular compression of the internal or external carotid artery by an elongated styloid process (Eagle Syndrome).6  
* Risks of CTA include exposure to ionizing radiation, thus, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is available as an alternative to reduce radiation exposure. In addition, MRA is an alternative for patients with iodinated contrast allergies or other contraindications to iodinated contrast.6,14  
* MRA, as an alternative modality, is noninvasive, and does not require iodinated contrast. Limitations include artifacts due to motion, slow or turbulent flow, and susceptibility effects, and claustrophobia. Additionally, MRA may not be a feasible option for those with contraindications to MRI such as incompatible pacemakers, cochlear implants, neurostimulators or other devices. In these scenarios, CTA may be the appropriate alternative.6,14,15

# Salivary Gland Disorders (Neck-11.1)

**NK.SG.0011.1.A**  
**v1.0.2025**

* **Xerostomia (Dry Mouth)**  
  * Salivary Gland Nuclear Imaging (one of CPT® 78230, CPT® 78231, or CPT® 78232) can be considered for any one of the following:  
    - Dry mouth and either:  
      - Sjögren’s syndrome  
      - Sialadenitis  
      - History of head or neck radiation therapy  
      - History of cerebral palsy  
      - Parotid mass to allow preoperative diagnosis of Warthin’s tumor  

* **Salivary Gland Stones, Sialadenitis or Stenosis:**[^1]  
  * Sialography (contrast dye injection) under fluoroscopy, can be performed to rule out a salivary duct stone or stricture, using  
    - Post-sialography CT (CT Maxillofacial without contrast [CPT® 70486] for Stensen's duct of the parotid gland, which would be most common; **or** CT Neck without contrast [CPT® 70490] for the level of the Wharton's Duct); **or** post-sialography MRI (MRI Orbit/Face/Neck without contrast [CPT® 70540]) **OR**  
  * CT Maxillofacial area with contrast (CPT® 70487) **OR**  
  * CT Neck with contrast (CPT® 70491)  
    - CT performed only without IV contrast (CPT® 70490) may be helpful in a small minority of cases, such as cases of follow-up for known salivary stones, or for post-sialography imaging, as described above **OR**  
  * MRI Orbit/Face/Neck without and with contrast (CPT® 70543)  

* **Parotid or Other Salivary Gland Mass**  
  * The following are appropriate:[^2]  
    - Ultrasound (CPT® 76536) is supported as initial or additional imaging and does not need to be completed prior to the performance of advanced imaging.  
    - MRI Orbit/Face/Neck without and with contrast preferred (CPT® 70543) **or** MRI Orbit/Face/Neck without contrast (CPT® 70540) **OR**  
    - CT Neck with contrast (CPT® 70491) preferred **or** CT Maxillofacial area with contrast (CPT® 70487)  

* **Repeat Imaging (CT or MRI, as above)**[^4]  
  * There is currently no standard timeframe for repeat advanced imaging to follow known benign pathology of the salivary gland that has been resected—partially or completely, or only observed. This holds true even if the salivary lesion has the potential for recurrence or malignant transformation (i.e., pleomorphic adenoma).

* Repeat advanced imaging, as requested by the surgeon or those in consultation with the surgical team, is indicated if recent history and exam demonstrate signs:  
  - concerning for complications of surgery, or  
  - recurrence or progression of neoplasm/lesion  

**Evidence Discussion**  
* Current history and comprehensive head & neck exam are required prior to any advanced imaging for suspected salivary gland pathology.  
* CT should be performed with IV contrast to distinguish vessels from lymph nodes and to confirm if a mass is hypervascular. *Dual-phase CT imaging (without and with IV contrast) is not supported.*[^2]  
  - CT performed only without IV contrast may be helpful in a small minority of cases including cases of follow-up for known salivary stones or post-sialography studies.  
* A recent study in the American Journal of Neuroradiology comparing contrast enhanced and non-contrast enhanced CT in the evaluation of sialolithiasis demonstrated excellent sensitivity and specificity with no false-positive results using contrast-enhanced CT alone (without the addition of non-contrasted images for comparison). Benefits of initial only contrast-enhanced CT include better evaluation of the ductal system, improved soft tissue contrast in assessing salivary masses and decreased radiation dose (compared to dual phase CT imaging (without and with IV contrast)).[^3]  
* The preferred modality to evaluate suspected parotid lesions is MRI of the face and/or neck with and without IV contrast. It can provide comprehensive information about the full extent of the mass (ie, deep lobe involvement) and other local invasion (such as perineural tumor spread and possible extension into the temporal bone).  
* Repeat Imaging (CT or MRI)[^4]  
  - There is currently no standard timeframe for repeat advanced imaging to follow known benign pathology of the salivary gland that has been resected—partially or completely, or only observed. This holds true even if the salivary lesion has the potential for recurrence or malignant transformation (i.e., pleomorphic adenoma).  
  - Repeat advanced imaging, as requested by the surgeon or those in consultation with the surgical team, is indicated if recent history and exam demonstrate signs:  
    * Concerning for complications of surgery, or  
    * Recurrence or progression of neoplasm/lesion

# Definitions (Neck-12.0)

**NK.ST.0012.0.A**  
**v1.0.2025**

* Hoarseness – Altered voice quality reported by the individual  
* Dysphagia – Disordered or impaired swallowing i.e., food impactions, globus sensation, choking/aspiration, regurgitation (see **Dysphagia and Upper Digestive Tract Disorders (Neck-3.1)**)  
* Odynophagia – Painful swallowing  


---


# Sore Throat/Throat Pain/Odynophagia (Neck-12.1)

**NK.ST.0012.1.A**  
*v1.0.2025*

* See **Dysphagia and Upper Digestive Tract Disorders (Neck-3.1)** for dysphagia as the primary symptom.  
* Sore Throat/Throat Pain/Odynophagia  
  - Uncomplicated viral or streptococcal pharyngitis with sore throat[^3]  
    * Imaging studies are not indicated. See **Neck Mass/Swelling/Adenopathy (Neck-5.1)** for suspected complications of pharyngitis/tonsillitis, such as a cervical space abscess.  
  - Postoperative throat pain or odynophagia after head and neck procedure with suspected complication of procedure:[^4]  
    * CT Neck with contrast (CPT® 70491)  
  - Sore throat/throat pain/odynophagia that is persistent or progressive for two or more weeks, in spite of any treatment measures or observation:  
    * Initial evaluation is laryngoscopy  
      - If the initial laryngoscopy is abnormal, or if it is negative, and if there is a continued suspicion of submucosal lesion of the pharynx[^2,^4] due to any red flag symptoms (weight loss, referred otalgia, hoarseness, hemoptysis, and/or unilateral presentation of symptoms):  
        + CT Neck with contrast (CPT® 70491) **OR**  
        + MRI Orbit/Face/Neck without and with contrast (CPT® 70543)  
      - Alarm symptoms of persistent unilateral throat pain or odynophagia with ipsilateral referred otalgia is especially suspicious for a submucosal tumor of the head and neck (versus more distal esophageal pathology).[^5]  
      - If subjective dysphagia **AND** odynophagia are both present and the initial laryngoscopy and neck exam are normal (i.e. no cervical space abscess or post-surgical complication is suspected), and no red flag symptoms are present, then barium esophagram (or GI upper endoscopy) is indicated prior to the advanced imaging studies of the neck listed above.[^5,^6]  

## Evidence Discussion

* Both CT and MRI can be used to delineate masses and provide cross sectional visualization of lesions that are deep to the mucosal surface. CT has the advantage to being readily available, requiring less time and less expense when compared to MRI.[^7,^8]

# Hoarseness (Neck-12.2)

**NK.ST.0012.2.A**  
**v1.0.2025**

* Laryngoscopy is the primary diagnostic modality for evaluating individuals with hoarseness. Imaging studies, including CT and MRI, are unnecessary in most individuals with hoarseness because most hoarseness is self-limited or caused by pathology that can be identified by laryngoscopy alone.
* The need for advanced imaging is based upon abnormal findings upon laryngoscopy,[^1] such as:  
  - Immobile or partially mobile vocal cord [see **Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Palsy (NECK-7.1)**]  
  - Any growth, asymmetry, ulceration, or other suspected neoplasm of the glottis or supraglottis [see **Neck Mass/Swelling/Adenopathy (Neck 5.1)**; see also **ONC-3.0-3.4**].
