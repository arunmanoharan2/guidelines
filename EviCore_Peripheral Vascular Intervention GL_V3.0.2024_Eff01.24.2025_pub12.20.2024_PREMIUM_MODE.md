Peripheral Vascular Intervention Guidelines V3.0.2024

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Ischemic rest pain | Pain arises from severe arterial occlusive disease in the lower extremities such that the patient experiences pain in the distal aspect of the foot and toes while the limb is in the supine position as would occur with sleep. The pain is relieved with the limb in the dependent position or "dangling from the bed" as the limb is depending on gravity to assist with perfusion. |
| NASCET | North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial |
| Pseudo-aneurysm | Outpouching of blood resulting from disruption of the arterial wall with extravasation of blood contained by periarterial connective tissue and not by the arterial wall layers. |
| PTA | Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. |
| Spider veins | Enlarged, tortuous veins that are usually distributed in a web like cluster. These veins are typically <3mm in diameter. |
| Stent | A metal scaffold placed inside the artery to maintain patency. |
| Stent-graft | A metal scaffold covered by fabric material placed inside an artery. |
| Symptomatic carotid stenosis | Characterized by either a transient ischemic attack or cerebrovascular accident that is in the distribution of known severe carotid stenosis, e.g. transient right sided upper and lower extremity paralysis in the setting of 70% left internal carotid artery stenosis. |
| Symptomatic aneurysm | Unrelenting non-positional back pain in the setting of a known abdominal or thoracic aortic aneurysm. Patients with a symptomatic aneurysm may or may not have evidence of a free or contained rupture. The presence of symptoms indicate impending rupture. |
| Varicose veins | Enlarged, tortuous veins often caused by incompetent valves. Veins are typically ≥3mm in diameter. |

|------|------------|
| Velocity ratio (V1/V2) | Ratio of peak systolic velocity in the diseased segment of blood vessel demonstrating elevated flow velocities to the peak systolic velocity of blood flow in normal vessel just proximal to area of concern in arteries, or just distal in veins. |
| Venous reflux | Characterized by incompetent or "leaky" valves that no longer function as one way valves facilitating the flow of blood from the lower extremities to the heart. This results in pooling of blood in the lower extremities leading to distended engorged veins when the lower extremities are in the dependent position as in sitting or standing. |

# General Information for Vascular Intervention Requests

PVI.100.A
v2.0.2024

## General requirements

eviCore applies an evidence-based approach to evaluate the most appropriate medically necessary care for each individual. This evaluation requires submission of legible medical records pertinent to the test, treatment, or procedure requested by the provider.

## Information to establish medical necessity

Medical necessity for the request cannot be established when the medical records provided cannot be read or do not include sufficiently detailed information to understand the individual's current clinical status.

Specific elements of an individual's medical records commonly required to establish medical necessity include, but are not limited to
• Recent (within 6 months) in-person clinical evaluation which includes a detailed history and physical examination
• Laboratory studies
• Imaging studies
• Pathology reports
• Procedure reports
• Reports from other providers participating in treatment of the relevant condition

## Documentation requirements for vascular intervention requests

Documentation requirements needed to complete a prior authorization request for vascular surgery include ALL of the following:
• Procedure proposed
• Condition being treated
• Detailed documentation of provider-directed conservative treatment, duration and frequency of treatment, and the response to such treatments, if applicable
• Detailed documentation of location and size of aneurysmal disease, if present

Peripheral Vascular Intervention Guidelines                                                        V3.0.2024

- Detailed documentation regarding nature of the critical limb ischemia: non-healing wound or ischemic rest pain, if applicable
- Recent (within 6 months) written reports of any of the following diagnostic imaging modalities and studies acceptable for purposes of the Vascular Surgery guidelines:
  - Ankle-brachial indices, segmental pressures and pulse volume recordings as applicable
  - Duplex ultrasound including carotid, lower extremity and abdominal
  - CTA abdomen/pelvis with or without lower extremity run-off
  - MRA abdomen/pelvis with or without lower extremity run-off
  - Angiogram
- Recent (within 6 months) clinical evaluation documenting:
  - Symptoms (if lifestyle-limiting, detailed documentation regarding quality of life parameters that are affected)
  - Physical exam findings

## Emergent and urgent requests

Individuals being evaluated for vascular/endovascular surgery should be screened for the presence of a medical condition that warrants urgent/emergent definitive surgical treatment. Provider directed non-surgical management is not required when there is documentation, supported by imaging studies or clinical assessment, of any of the following urgent/emergent conditions:
- Critical limb ischemia
- Symptomatic carotid stenosis
- Crescendo TIA's (multiple recurrent episodes of TIA over hours to days)
- Symptomatic or ruptured aneurysms
An urgent/emergent request based on 2018 NCQA standards for utilization management occurs when the time frame for making routine or non-life threatening determinations on care either:
- Could seriously jeopardize the life, health, or safety of the member or others, due to the member's psychological state
- In the opinion of a practitioner with knowledge of the member's medical or behavioral condition, would subject the member to adverse health consequences without the care or treatment that is the subject of the request.
Procedures to treat arterial disease may be indicated on an intra-operative basis

## Background and supporting information

Prior-authorization requests should be submitted at least two weeks prior to the anticipated date of an elective surgery.

Non-indications
• Endovascular treatment is not indicated for intracranial atherosclerosis

Background and supporting information

Cerebral aneurysm is a bulging, weakened area in the wall of a blood vessel resulting in an abnormal widening or ballooning greater than 50% of the vessel's normal diameter (width).

The causes of aneurysms are varied. They may be congenital or hereditary, or may be caused by other medical conditions or injury.

The risk of rupture for an asymptomatic aneurysm is 1% per year or less, this risk increases with size, size increase over time, family history, and history of prior subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Endovascular treatment options for aneurysm include coil embolization, balloon remodeling, stent-assisted coil embolization, and/or flow diverters. Treatments for ruptured cerebral aneurysms include surgical clipping, endovascular coiling and/or use of flow diverters. Stenting of a ruptured aneurysm is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and is only considered when less risky options are not available. Cerebral angioplasty is reasonable in patients with symptomatic cerebral vasospasm, particularly those not responding to hypertensive therapy. Treatment should be done early to prevent re-rupture. With conservative management, the risk of aneurysm re-bleeding is 20% to 30% in the first month and then approximately 3% per year.

Most brain AVMs are sporadic and do not have an underlying genetic cause. Conservative management, endovascular embolization, radiation and operative resection are four modalities that can be considered in the treatment of brain AVM. These modalities may be performed either in isolation or in combination.

Intracranial atherosclerosis: Stroke or TIA (transient ischemic attack) can be caused by symptomatic intracranial atherosclerosis. For patients with cerebral ischemia attributable to stenosis of an intracranial artery, the mainstay of treatment consists of risk factor modification and medications. Angioplasty and/or stenting is generally not recommended given the low rate of stroke on medical management and the inherent peri-procedural risk of endovascular treatment. Intervention may be considered on a case-by-case basis for failure of maximal medical therapy in complex scenarios.

# Carotid revascularization - Criteria

## General information

The determination of medical necessity for the performance of carotid revascularization is always made on a case-by-case basis based on the following information:
• For prior authorization requirements, see Prior Authorization Requirements
• The presence of urgent/emergent indications/conditions warrants definitive surgical/ endovascular treatment in lieu of provider-directed non-surgical management. Urgent/ emergent conditions for carotid revascularization include ANY of the following
    ◦ Crescendo TIA's
    ◦ Transient monocular blindness, amaurosis fugax
    ◦ Free-floating thrombus
    ◦ Enlarging carotid pseudoaneurysm
    ◦ Infection of carotid patch placed during prior carotid endarterectomy
    ◦ Recent CVA or TIA
• Confirmatory imaging studies and clinical notes are required

## Carotid endarterectomy (CEA)

### Indications

Carotid endarterectomy is a procedure that involves making an incision into the internal carotid artery with surgical removal of atherosclerotic plaque and subsequent closure of the artery primarily or with a patch
• CEA is considered medical necessary when one of the following is met
    ◦ Symptomatic carotid stenosis-when there is documentation of both
       ▪ Carotid lesion corresponds anatomically to the individual's symptoms or CTA or MRA findings in the distribution of carotid lesion and one of the following:
           - 50-99% stenosis by angiogram, CTA, MRA
           - Carotid duplex >70% (the lower value should be >70% if reported as a range) otherwise CTA or MRA needed to confirm
       Documentation of any of the following
           - Transient ischemic attack (TIA)
           - Focal cerebral ischemia producing a non-disabling stroke
           - Transient monocular blindness (amaurosis fugax)
    ◦ Asymptomatic carotid stenosis (as documented by clinical notes):

## Carotid angioplasty or stent

### Carotid stenting (CAS)

Carotid stenting (CAS) for atherosclerotic disease is considered medically necessary when all of the following
- Criteria for CEA has been met with one of the following
    - Symptomatic carotid stenosis (as documented by clinical notes) demonstrated to be ≥70% via carotid duplex, CTA or MRA or angiography within six months and any of the following:
        - Transient ischemic attack (TIA)
        - Focal cerebral ischemia producing a non-disabling stroke
        - Transient monocular blindness (amaurosis fugax)
    - Asymptomatic carotid stenosis (as documented by clinical notes) >80% demonstrated via carotid duplex, CTA, MRA or angiography within six months (carotid stenosis documented by duplex must be confirmed by angiography prior to performing the procedure)
- Individual is considered high risk for CEA due to a documented history of any of the following significant comorbidities or anatomic risk factors:
    - Significant comorbid conditions including but not limited to
        - Congestive heart failure (CHF) class III/IV
        - Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <30 %
        - Unstable angina
        - Angina with known >2 vessel CAD
        - Severe COPD
        - ESRD
        - Age 75 or older
        - Recent (within the last six months) myocardial infarction (MI)
    - Anatomic risk factors include
        - Recurrent stenosis in the setting of a previous CEA at any time
        - Prior radiation treatment to the neck
        - Previous radical neck dissection at any time
        - Permanent contralateral cranial nerve injury
        - Contralateral carotid occlusion
        - Tandem high grade stenosis on the same side
        - High cervical carotid stenosis above C2 vertebral body
- Carotid artery stenosis shall be measured by carotid duplex, CT or MR imaging or angiography and recorded in the patient's medical records (carotid stenosis documented by duplex must be confirmed by angiography prior to performing the procedure)

Peripheral Vascular Intervention Guidelines V3.0.2024

- If the stenosis is measured by ultrasound prior to the procedure, then the degree of stenosis must be confirmed by angiography at the start of the procedure. Angiography can be performed at the time of the planned intervention.

## Transcarotid stenting (TCAR)

- TCAR is considered medically necessary when criteria for CEA has been met AND
  - Has one high risk criteria for CEA (see above), AND
  - No anatomical or technical contraindications to performing the procedure are documented by intervention in addition to all of the following:
    - CCA is at least 6 mm diameter
    - No prior CCA intervention including stenting
    - No concern for contralateral vagus or recurrent laryngeal nerve injury
    - CCA length of at least 5 cm prior to bifurcation

## Carotid revascularization non-indications

Carotid revascularization (CEA or CAS) is not medically necessary in individuals who have had a disabling stroke (modified Rankin scale ≥ 3)

Asymptomatic carotid patients should have an adequate life expectancy to benefit from a carotid intervention.

## Extracranial vertebral artery stenosis

### Treatment of extracranial vertebral artery stenosis

Extracranial vertebral artery angioplasty with stent placement is considered medically necessary when all the following criteria are met:
- Failure of antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation therapy
- One of the following recurrent symptoms after treatment of nonvascular etiologies:
  - Dizziness
  - Unilateral limb weakness
  - Dysarthria
  - Recurrent headache
  - Recurrent nausea/vomiting
  - Recurrent posterior circulation embolic stroke
- One of the following criteria are met:
  - 60-99% bilateral extracranial vertebral artery stenosis
  - 60-99% unilateral extracranial vertebral artery stenosis in the setting of any of the following:

Peripheral Vascular Intervention Guidelines V3.0.2024

- A dominant vertebral and hypoplastic contralateral vertebral
- Contralateral vertebral ends in posteroinferior cerebellar
- Contralateral vertebral is occluded

Non-indications

• Extracranial vertebral artery angioplasty with stent placement is considered
experimental, investigational, or unproven for treatment of any other indication,
including asymptomatic vertebral artery stenosis

## Background and supporting information

### Carotid Endarterectomy

Symptoms of carotid stenosis include transient ischemic attack (distinct focal
neurological dysfunction persisting less than 24 hours), focal cerebral ischemia
producing a non-disabling stroke (modified Rankin scale <3 with symptoms for 24 hours
or more), and transient monocular blindness (amaurosis fugax).

Carotid endarterectomy is a procedure that involves making an incision into the
internal carotid artery with surgical removal of atherosclerotic plaque and subsequent
closure of the artery primarily or with a patch. The procedure can involve the use of
measures supportive of intracranial circulation during clamp time including placement
of an intra-arterial shunt or neuromonitoring such as electroencephalogram (EEG) or
somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPS). In some patients who are noted to be at high
risk for CEA secondary to medical co-morbidities or anatomic risk factors such as prior
radiation or redo operation, carotid stenting can be considered.

### Carotid Angioplasty and Stenting and TCAR

Carotid angioplasty/stenting form of carotid revascularization for atherosclerotic disease
in which a stent and more often than not a balloon prior to that are placed over a wire
through the lesion of interest to dilate and resolve a stenosis. Since threading a wire
through plaque can potentially lead to fracturing and embolization of the plaque into the
distal intracranial circulation, an embolic protection device is generally employed during
carotid stenting. Carotid stenting is also indicated to treat aneurysmal disease involving
the carotid artery. Carotid stenting is an option for patients who are considered high risk
for CEA and is offered as an alternative to CEA.

CMS has determined that CAS with embolic protection is reasonable and necessary
only if performed in facilities that have been determined to be competent in performing
the evaluation, procedure and follow-up necessary to ensure optimal patient outcomes.
Standards to determine competency include specific physician training standards, facility

support requirements and data collection to evaluate outcomes during a required re-
evaluation.

TCAR is a method of deploying a transcarotid stent under reverse carotid flow to
reduce the incidence of cerebral embolization. This offers low procedural stroke rates in
individuals who are considered high risk.

## Thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta - criteria

### General guidelines

Indications for intervention include one of the following:
- Aneurysm formation, including pseudoaneurysm
- Traumatic aortic transection and its sequelae including rupture, hemothorax, pseudoaneurysm
- Dissection of the aorta, acute and chronic, including intramural hematoma
- Penetrating aortic ulcer
- Coarctation of the aorta

Urgent/emergent request with regard to thoracic aortic pathology are not rare and are indicated when patients are symptomatic, defined as any of the following:
- Cases of active bleeding in the area of the pathology (e.g., hemothorax, pericardial effusion, free fluid in the abdomen)
- Contained or uncontained rupture
- Acute limb ischemia
- Visceral ischemia, noted as abdominal pain from mesenteric ischemia or elevated creatinine from renal ischemia
- Paralysis of bilateral lower extremities secondary to spinal cord ischemia

### Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm

Repair of a thoracic aortic aneurysm via open surgical repair or TEVAR is considered medically necessary when any of the following criteria are met:
- Thoracic aorta ≥5.5cm in asymptomatic patients as documented by CTA/MRA chest
- Thoracic aorta of any size in a patient with a thoracoabdominal aneurysm in which the abdominal aortic aneurysm is ≥5 cm as documented by CTA/MRA chest

• Any aneurysm ≥4cm in an individual with Marfan's syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos or
    Loeys-Dietz at the discretion of the surgeon
• Aneurysm growth rate of ≥1.0 cm/yr in an aorta with a diameter ≥4 cm and ≤5.5 cm
    as documented by CTA/MRA chest

## Descending thoracic aortic dissection

These guidelines refer to either a type B dissection, distal to the descending thoracic
aorta or to a previously repaired type A dissection with extension into the descending
thoracic aorta.
• Repair of hyperacute (<24 hours from onset of symptoms) and acute type B (1 to 14
    days since onset of symptoms) aortic dissection is considered medically necessary
    when any of the following is present:
    ◦ Acute limb ischemia or malperfusion as documented by clinical notes
    ◦ Persistent back pain despite adequate blood pressure control documented by
       clinical notes
    ◦ Aortic expansion ≥6cm documented by CTA/MRA chest
    ◦ Progression of dissection to involve previously uninvolved areas of the aorta
       documented by CTA/MRA chest
• Repair of a sub-acute type B aortic dissection (15-90 days since onset of symptoms)
    is considered medically necessary in the event of any of the following:
    ◦ Persistent back pain despite adequate blood pressure control documented by
       clinical noted
    ◦ Pseudoaneurysm formation documented by CTA/MRA chest
    ◦ Progression of dissection to involve previously uninvolved sections of the aorta
       documented by CTA/MRA chest
    ◦ Interval increase in the aortic diameter by ≥0.5cm documented by CTA/MRA chest
    ◦ Dynamic flap presenting with intermittent ischemia as detected by clinical
       presentation
• Repair of a chronic type B aortic dissection (>90 days since onset of symptoms) is
    considered medically necessary in the event of either:
    ◦ Aneurysmal degeneration of the aorta to a diameter ≥5.5cm documented by CTA/
       MRA chest
    ◦ Development of high grade stenosis of the aorta or its branches documented by
       CTA/MRA chest
• A TEVAR procedure is considered medically necessary for subsequent repair of the
    thoracic aorta in patients with a previously treated type A dissection with an elephant
    trunk or equivalent

## Traumatic aortic transection

Typically, traumatic aortic transections are treated emergently but can in certain cases be monitored and treated expectantly.

TEVAR is considered medically necessary in patients with a known Grade 1 traumatic aortic transection if subsequent imaging demonstrates any of the following:
- Pseudoaneurysm formation
- Intramural hematoma formation
- Hemothorax without overt rupture of the thoracic aorta
- Suspected rupture of the thoracic aorta

## Other pathologies

TEVAR is considered medically necessary to treat symptomatic high grade stenosis, aneurysmal disease, or impending or frank rupture when there are other pathologies affecting the thoracic aorta including but not limited to:
- Coarctation of the aorta when both:
  - Confirmed by CTA/MRA Chest
  - Symptomatic clinical presentation
- Thoracic Aorta Intramural Hematoma (IMH) and Penetrating Aortic Ulcer (PAU) confirmed by CTA/MRA Chest
- Various vasculitides with high grade stenosis or aneurysm confirmed by CTA/MRA Chest

## Abdominal Aortic Dissection, Intramural hematoma, Penetrating Aortic Ulcer

TEVAR, or EVAR is considered medically necessary to treat aortic dissection affecting the abdominal aorta for any of the following:
- Symptomatic including recurrent or persistent abdominal or back pain despite medical management
- Presents with ischemia of the visceral organs including the bowels and solid organ

## Background and supporting information

The ascending aorta is generally the purview of the cardiothoracic surgeon and the descending thoracic aorta is generally within the purview of the vascular surgeon.
If the pathology overlaps between the ascending and descending aorta, hybrid procedures involving first repair of the ascending aorta by the cardiothoracic surgeon and subsequent repair of the descending thoracic aorta by the vascular surgeon is common.

## Abdominal Aorta - criteria

### General Guidelines
Urgent/emergent requests are for symptomatic patients and are indicated in any of the following conditions:
• Cases of active bleeding
• Impending rupture
• Acute limb ischemia
• Paralysis

### Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm - criteria
Repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm via open surgical repair or EVAR is considered medically necessary when ANY of the following criteria are met:
• Abdominal aorta ≥5cm in asymptomatic patients documented by imaging
• Abdominal aortic aneurysm of any size ≥3cm in a patient with a thoracoabdominal aneurysm in which the thoracic aortic aneurysm is ≥6cm documented by imaging

• Pseudoaneurysm formation documented by imaging
• Progression of dissection to involve previously uninvolved portions of the aorta
  documented by imaging
• Continued expansion of the aortic diameter ≥0.5cm documented by imaging
• Dynamic flap presenting with intermittent ischemia as documented by clinical signs/
  symptoms
Repair of a chronic type B aortic dissection (>90 days since onset of symptoms) treated
with medical management is considered medically necessary in the event of either of
the following:
• Aneurysmal degeneration of the aorta to a diameter ≥5 cm
• Development of high grade stenosis of the aorta or its branches documented by
  imaging

## Iliac Artery Aneurysm

### Criteria
Treatment is indicated for a common iliac artery aneurysm ≥3cm in diameter.
Endovascular repair of iliac artery by deployment of an iliac branched endograft (CPT®
34717) is medically necessary if there is documentation of all of the following criteria:
• Endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair is planned to be performed at
  the same time as the internal iliac artery (IIA) procedure
• The ipsilateral common iliac artery demonstrates an aneurysm that meets criteria for
  clinical significance (greater than 3.5 cm in diameter)
• There is contralateral internal iliac artery occlusion
Bifurcated-bifurcated aneurysm repair of aorto-iliac aneurysms is considered
experimental, investigational, and unproven because the effectiveness of this approach
has not been established.

## Background and supporting information

Procedures to address abdominal aortic pathology fall into two broad categories open
surgical repair conducted via a laparotomy and endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) which
is a minimally invasive approach via the femoral artery to treat aortic pathology with a
stent graft.

# Peripheral Vascular, Non-coronary Stents

PVI.104.A
v2.0.2024

## General information

Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease and patients will often present with multi-level disease. Intraoperative decision making may lead to changes in the original procedure requested. Sequential procedures may also be indicated during the procedure to maintain or re-establish patency. These additional procedures are necessary because the initial approach was unsuccessful or only partially successful with regard to patency of the target vessel.

Procedures for peripheral atherosclerosis can include:
- Surgery, including surgical exposure of vessels, endarterectomy or bypass
- Open or percutaneous thrombectomy
- Open or percutaneous embolectomy
- Atherectomy
- Catheter directed thrombolysis
- Additional PTA or stent placement

## Peripheral vascular, non-coronary stent - criteria

### General Guidelines

It is expected that all lesions needing treatment will be addressed in one procedure. Staging of interventions is not indicated unless there is justification in the medical record. Valid reasons include any of the following:
- Patient instability
- Fluoroscopy use in excess of what is widely considered a safe radiation dosage
- A need to convert to general anesthesia but resources are not available
- Contrast volume given is greater than 250 ml

Primary stenting is medically necessary when Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) alone is not expected to provide a durable result for patients with either of the following:
- Arterial occlusions that carry a high risk for distal embolization or rapid recurrence
- Occlusive lesions such as significantly calcified lesions, eccentric lesions, lesions related to external compression, and ostial lesions.

- Functional limitations that significantly impact the quality of life and/or
  occupation of the patient
- Risk factor modification including smoking cessation, optimization of lipids, and
  glycemic control are part of the medical evaluation and management
- Symptoms correspond with the location of arterial insufficiency
  - aorto-iliac -lower back, hip, buttock, or thigh
  - superficial femoral - claudication in the calf muscle area
  - popliteal - calf or foot
  - infra - popliteal arteries- ankle and foot

Note:
Intervention for below knee vessels is unsupported for the treatment of
claudication.

• Imaging performed prior to the planned procedure confirms location and degree of
  stenosis (≥50%) by objective criteria.
• Treatment of target lesion will allow inline flow to the foot, with at least one run-off
  vessel

Repeat intervention

• Re-intervention in a patient who has previously undergone angioplasty/stenting
  or bypass in the lower extremity arteries (aorto-iliac, superficial femoral and infra-
  popliteal arteries) for critical limb ischemia considered medically necessary for any
  one of the following:
  - Previous Endovascular Intervention: Drop in ABI of ≥0.15 on routine surveillance or
    duplex finding of peak systolic velocity (PSV) ≥190 cm/s or Velocity ratio ≥1.5 AND
    one of the following:
    - Recurrence of rest pain and/or claudication as documented by clinical notes
    - Progression of wound as defined by any increase in size of the wound, new
      infection or lack of 50% area reduction in 4 weeks
  - Previous Lower Extremity Bypass: Drop in ABI of ≥0.15 on routine surveillance
    AND one of the following:
    - Recurrence of rest pain and/or claudication as documented by clinical notes
    - Progression of wound as defined by any increase in size of the wound, new
      infection or lack of 50% area reduction in 4 weeks OR
    - If Vein bypass: PSV ≥180 cm/s or Velocity ratio ≥2, or end diastolic velocity
      (EDV) <45 cm/s
    - If Prosthetic bypass: low graft velocity <45 cm/s

Peripheral Vascular Intervention Guidelines V3.0.2024

• Re-intervention in a patient who has previously undergone angioplasty/stenting for
claudication is appropriate when there is recurrent symptomatology in the setting of
noninvasive studies demonstrating any of the following:
   ◦ Drop in ABI of ≥0.15 or a drop from a normal ABI back to an abnormal ABI (<0.9)
   ◦ Recurrent lesion seen on recent duplex (within three months)
   ◦ New lesion seen on recent duplex (within three months)
• In asymptomatic patients:
   ◦ If Vein bypass: PSV ≥180 cm/s or Velocity ratio ≥2, or EDV <45 cm/s
   ◦ If Prosthetic bypass: low graft velocity <45 cm/s
   ◦ Stent with high grade stenosis defined as PSV ≥275 cm/s or Velocity ratio ≥3.5
• Stent placement in infra-popliteal vessels is almost never indicated and in those
cases, the rationale for stent placement must be thoroughly explained in the record.

## Atherectomy
### Critical limb ischemia

Atherectomy is indicated for critical limb ischemia, including tissue loss and ischemic
rest pain, AND the patient would otherwise satisfy criteria for intervention

### Claudication

Atherectomy is indicated for claudication as an adjunct to angioplasty prior to stenting
when all of the following are met:
• Criteria for intervention have been met
• Lesions result in ≥70% stenosis caused by a highly calcified eccentric plaque
• Treatment of target lesion will establish inline flow to the foot, with at least 1 runoff
vessel
• Lesion is 20 cm or less in length
• Debulking to <30% diameter stenosis is attainable

## Peripheral vascular, non-coronary stents non-indications

Stent placement in infrapopliteal vessels is not medically necessary except in rare cases
where it is deemed necessary intraoperatively.

PTA or stent is not considered medically necessary in either:
• Individuals who are asymptomatic
• Lesions that are not high-grade or critical (≥50%)

## Background and supporting information

Atherosclerotic plaque can lead to stenosis and even occlusion of the peripheral
vasculature. High-grade stenosis can lead to chronic ischemia of the end tissue, with
resultant symptoms of arterial insufficiency. In the lower extremities, this can lead to
claudication and/or critical limb ischemia. Treatment of stenotic or occlusive lesions can
be performed with angioplasty alone which involves placing a balloon through a wire
across the lesion and dilating the lesion to residual stenosis of <30%. Stenting involves
placing a metal stent permanent implant across a lesion dilating it with a balloon and
leaving it in place effectively crushing and fixing the plaque against the arterial wall.
Angioplasty can be performed alone or in conjunction with stenting. A stent may be
placed as a planned adjunct to PTA rather than in response to a sub-optimal or failed
PTA (so-called primary stent deployment).

Coverage for non-coronary vascular stents depends on the use of an FDA-approved
stent for an FDA approved indication

# General Information for Venous Intervention Requests

PVI.200.A
v2.0.2024

## General requirements

eviCore applies an evidence-based approach to evaluate the most appropriate medically necessary care for each patient. This evaluation requires submission of legible medical records pertinent to the test, treatment, or procedure requested by the provider.

## Information to establish medical necessity

Medical necessity for the request cannot be established when the medical records provided cannot be read or do not include sufficiently detailed information to understand the individual's current clinical status.

Specific elements of an individual's medical records commonly required to establish medical necessity include, but are not limited to
• Recent (within 6 months) in-person clinical evaluation which includes a detailed history and physical examination
• Laboratory studies
• Imaging studies
• Pathology reports
• Procedure reports
• Reports from other providers participating in treatment of the relevant condition

## Documentation requirements for venous intervention requests

Documentation requirements needed to complete a prior authorization request for vascular surgery include ALL of the following:
• Procedure proposed
• Condition being treated
• Detailed documentation of provider-directed conservative treatment, duration and frequency of treatment, as well as subjective results of the conservative therapy, and the response to such treatments

Peripheral Vascular Intervention Guidelines V3.0.2024

- Recent (within 6 months) written reports (interpreted by an independent radiologist) of any of the following diagnostic imaging modalities acceptable for purposes of the Vascular Surgery guidelines:
  - Venous duplex
  - CTV abdomen/pelvis
  - MRV abdomen/pelvis
  - Venogram
  - IVUS – intravascular ultrasound
- Recent (within 6 months) clinical evaluation documenting:
  - Patient symptoms
  - Physical exam findings

## Background and supporting information

Prior-authorization requests should be submitted at least two weeks prior to the anticipated date of an elective venous surgery

Multiple procedures may be indicated in a patient to treat venous disease. They can be performed simultaneously or sequentially. In general, the larger veins are treated first with the expectation that it might limit the amount of smaller procedures performed. However, the more symptomatic veins can be treated first.

## Saphenovenous Reflux Treatment- Criteria

Endovenous ablation is the preferred treatment for saphenovenous reflux. High ligation and stripping can be considered when prior imaging demonstrates a relative contraindication to endovenous ablation including any of the following:
• Tortuous saphenous vein
• Aneurysmal saphenous vein (>20mm)
• Presence of intraluminal calcified valves precluding placement of catheter

Treatment of saphenovenous reflux is not medically necessary for an asymptomatic state or for purposes of cosmesis.

Treatment of saphenovenous reflux is medically necessary when both of the following apply
• Symptoms of venous reflux are documented by one of the following
    ◦ Venous ulcer of the lower leg
    ◦ Bleeding
    ◦ Superficial phlebitis
    ◦ Documentation of both of the following
       ▪ Any of the following symptoms of venous reflux
           - Significant pain, heaviness, achiness, fatigue, or throbbing of the lower extremity after prolonged standing
           - Refractory venous edema that interferes with activities of daily living (when other causes of lower extremity swelling have been excluded)
           - Stasis dermatitis
       ▪ Trial of 8 weeks of conservative therapy, including graded compression stockings, AND any of the following (exercise, periodic elevation, and weight loss (if applicable)), was unsuccessful due to ANY of the following reasons
           - No resolution of symptoms

- Results of a recent venous duplex (within 6 months before planned procedure) demonstrates all of the following
  - Presence of significant pathologic reflux measuring at least 500ms within ANY of the following vein to be treated:
    - great saphenous vein
    - lesser saphenous vein
    - anterior accessory saphenous
    - posterior accessory saphenous vein
  - Absence of DVT

## Background and supporting information

Endovenous ablation has been developed as a minimally invasive alternative to saphenous vein ligation and stripping. The procedure is designed to damage the intimal wall of the vein, resulting in fibrosis and subsequent obliteration of the lumen of a segment of the vessel thus eliminating reflux. Laser or radiofrequency ablation is performed by means of a specially designed catheter inserted through a small incision in the distal vein directed under ultrasound guidance to within 2 cm of the saphenofemoral junction. Laser or radiofrequency fibers on the tip of the catheter cause direct heating of the vessel wall, causing the vein to close as the catheter is slowly withdrawn.

Cyanoacrylate (VenaSeal™) closure is performed in a similar fashion, with small aliquots of glue placed along the course of the vein under ultrasound guidance, occluding the vein. Mechanochemical ablation is performed with the use of an oscillating catheter to disrupt the intima in conjunction with a sclerosant. Ablation with Varithena™ (polidocanol injectable foam) 1% is performed via injection of a non-compounded sclerosant into the vein via injection through a sheath or butterfly needle.

Since endovenous ablation via whatever method carries a 1% complication risk of DVT, a venous duplex (CPT® 93970, 93971) to rule out an acute DVT can be approved within seven days of the procedure.

High ligation and stripping is a more invasive method of treating saphenous vein reflux than endovenous ablation and has been declining in frequency. This surgery involves tying off the great or small saphenous vein at its junction with the deep system and stripping all or a large segment of the vein essentially removing the dysfunctional vein from the body. High ligation and stripping of the saphenous vein can also be accompanied by phlebectomy of individual varicose vein tributaries.

High ligation of the saphenous vein WITHOUT stripping should NOT be performed in the absence of stripping. High ligation of the saphenous vein in the absence of stripping has been shown to have a high rate or recurrence.

## Treatment of varicose veins - criteria

Treatment is indicated when ALL of the following have been met:
- Results of a recent venous duplex (completed within 6 months prior to date of scheduled procedure) demonstrate refluxing varicosities to be (both)
  - ≥3mm in size
  - With ≥500ms of reflux
- Documented symptoms/clinical findings of venous reflux include any of the following
  - Significant pain, heaviness, achiness, fatigue, throbbing of the lower extremity after prolonged standing despite conservative therapy of ≥8 weeks
  - Refractory venous edema that interferes with activities of daily living with exclusion of other causes of lower extremity swelling
- Documentation includes history of one or more of the following:
  - Venous ulcer of the lower leg
  - Bleeding associated with varicosities of the lower extremities
  - Superficial phlebitis
  - Recent (within the last 6 months) trial of provider-directed 8 weeks of conservative therapy has failed due to (any)
    - No resolution of symptoms
    - Minimal improvement but continued life limiting symptoms
    - Symptoms worsened and conservative treatment was stopped

Individuals who have both documented axial vein reflux in the saphenous veins as well as non-saphenous varicose veins, treatment of the varicose veins (phlebectomy or sclerotherapy) is indicated either:
- Concurrently at time of treatment of the saphenous vein reflux
- After 6 weeks of observation if symptoms have failed to resolve (conservative therapy is not required)

Ambulatory phlebectomy and/or sclerotherapy <6 weeks after endovenous ablation is not considered medically necessary

400 Buckwalter Place Boulevard, Bluffton, SC 29910 (800) 918-8924                                 www.EviCore.com

Peripheral Vascular Intervention Guidelines                                                                                   V3.0.2024

Sclerotherapy of veins <3mm is indicated in certain cases as follows:
• The spider/reticular vein is symptomatic with spontaneous bleeding episodes
• Documented signs and symptoms of venous stasis disease ulcerations and exhibits
    corona phlebectatica (spider veins at the ankle, predominantly the medial malleolus)

## Background and supporting information

Phlebectomy involves the removal of individual varicose veins via small incisions in the
skin and either via tying off or avulsing the vein. When saphenous vein reflux is present,
this should be treated prior to phlebectomy.

Sclerotherapy treatment destroys the lining of the affected vein by injecting an irritant
solution (either a detergent, osmotic solution, or a chemical irritant) directly into the
vessel resulting in obliteration of the vessel. Types of sclerotherapy include liquid
sclerotherapy with hypertonic saline, polidocanol or sotradecol or non compounded
foam sclerotherapy (Varithena).

Post procedure assessment by imaging techniques is inappropriate to confirm efficacy
or outcome of phlebectomy or sclerotherapy.

# Treatment of Pathologic Perforators

PVI.203.A
v2.0.2024

## General information

Perforator veins perforate the deep fascia to connect superficial veins to deep veins.

Treatment of pathologic perforators (≥3.5 mm in size with ≥500 ms of pathologic reflux) is via
- Endovenous ablation – insertion of a catheter emitting radiofrequency or laser that ablates the perforator
- Ligation - an open surgical procedure which involves tying off the pathologic perforator
- Sub-fascial endoscopic perforator surgery – a minimally invasive procedure that involves ligating pathologic perforators
- US guided foam sclerotherapy

## Coding

### Treatment of pathologic perforators- criteria

#### Indications

Treatment of pathologic perforators is indicated when there is documentation of ALL of the following:
- Venous stasis ulcer
- A recent (within past 6 months) US demonstrates signs of perforator vein incompetence with (both)
  - Reflux ≥500ms
  - Vein diameter ≥3.5 mm
- Perforator vein is located in the vicinity of an active ulcer
- Superficial refluxing saphenous veins have been previously eliminated

### Background and supporting information

Perforating veins extend medially to laterally in a horizontal fashion and are located at numerous locations throughout the lower extremity and directly connect the superficial system to the deep system. Perforating veins usually penetrate the musculature to connect the superficial and deep venous systems. Pathologic perforators located directly under the wound bed of a non-healing ulcer can cause delays in wound healing and treatment can expedite closure of the wound. Treatment of pathologic perforators is not indicated for any other pathology other than stasis ulcer.

Sub-fascial endoscopic perforator surgery (SEPS) is a procedure used to ameliorate the venous hypertension that contributes to the formation and delayed healing of venous stasis ulcers. Via an endoscope through a small incision, an instrument is used to either ablate or ligate the pathologic perforator.

Peripheral Vascular Intervention Guidelines                                                                                   V3.0.2024

Incompletely lysed DVT can cause luminal narrowing of the vein restricting venous
outflow leading to stenosis or occlusion and /or can lead to valve dysfunction resulting
in reflux of venous blood retrograde towards gravity. Both pathologies ultimately lead to
chronic edema which can cause chronic pain and venous stasis disease. The mainstay
of treatment for chronic deep venous thrombosis is compression stockings. Individuals
whose symptoms are not relieved with conservative therapy may be a candidates for
iliac vein angioplasty/stenting.

Iliac vein compression is an entity known as May-Thurner syndrome and affects the
left iliac vein which can lead to chronic edema, varicose veins and venous stasis
ulcerations. In approximately 25% of people, the right iliac artery overlies the left iliac
vein over the fifth lumbar vertebra and its pulsations can compress the vein increasing
the risk of DVT in the left extremity. Treatment is with iliac vein angioplasty/stenting for
both acute and chronic left-sided DVT. Prophylactic treatment of May-Thurner syndrome
in the absence of acute or chronic DVT OR chronic left lower extremity edema and its
sequelae such as varicose veins or venous stasis ulcers is NOT considered medically
necessary.

## Indications for Varicocele Embolization

Venous embolization of a varicocele documented on physical exam or ultrasound
imaging is considered medically necessary for either of the following clinical scenarios:
• Management of infertility with palpable varicocele
• Recurrent varicocele

## Evidence Discussion

Initially, PAE was used in patients with hematuria secondary to prostatic origin with
significant success. Over the past 20 years, several trials have been performed
to look at prostatic artery embolization for BPH/LUTS. The majority of the studies
compared PAE to TURP with some initial trials comparing PAE to SHAM for efficacy.
All trials showed improvement in symptoms compared to baseline as confirmed in the
SHAM trials. When comparing PAE to TURP, several randomized, controlled studies
showed the outcomes are similar for symptom relief of symptoms with better volume
reduction and long-term outcomes with TURP. However, TURP is also associated with
higher rates of incontinence and sexual dysfunction including erectile dysfunction and
ejaculatory issues. In 2024 the AUA released an amendment to their guidelines stating
that PAE may be offered as be offered for the treatment of LUTS/BPH. They noted that
continued evaluation of PAE in trials is need but there is evidence for its use in select
patients.

Varicocele development may occur in all age groups and may lead to pain, testicular
swelling and may have an impact on fertility. Management of varicoceles for male
infertility remains somewhat controversial based on a recent global survey by Shah
et al in 2022. The majority are still being managed by surgical technique with only
2.6% of respondents citing embolization or sclerotherapy as their preferred repair
technique. The risk of hydrocele and spermatic artery injury are associated with
surgical repair and eliminated with embolization procedures. A review of the available
guidelines included a meta-analysis of varicocele and fertility studies in 2016 and a more
recent study by Sheehan et al, both showed a positive impact in sperm concentration,
motility and morphology after varicocele embolization. These findings would support
an improvement in male fertility following embolization. This is also supported in the
AUA/ASRM guideline on infertility in Men published in 2021. Venous embolization
of varicoceles has been shown to be effective in decreasing pain with durability of
symptom relief over 4 years. The American Vein and Lymphatic Society working
group on pelvic venous disorders include varicocele in their definition of pelvic venous
disorders (PeVD) as result of extra pelvic varices that may result from pelvic origins
(V3a) along with vulvar varices in 2021. Pelvic vein embolization is supported for the
management of V3a varices.

Peripheral Vascular Intervention Guidelines V3.0.2024

- stable sac size when both of the following apply
  - sac size is ≥5cm
  - Type 2 endoleak is present ≥two years

## Embolization as an adjunct to EVAR
- Internal iliac (hypogastric) artery embolization prior to EVAR is considered medically necessary when a common iliac artery aneurysm requiring stenting to the level of the external iliac artery is identified pre-operatively.
- Embolization of aortic side branches is medically necessary in individuals with a Type 2 endoleak with sac enlargement.

## Non-indications
- Embolization of aortic side branches prior to EVAR for the purpose of preventing Type 2 endoleak is not medically necessary. This includes but is not limited to the embolization of lumbar arteries and internal mesenteric arteries.

## Ovarian vein embolization

Ovarian Vein Embolization is medically necessary for the treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome when all of the following apply:
- Chronic pelvic pain of more than six months duration accompanied by any of the following criteria:
  - Pain exacerbated by walking, standing, and fatigue
  - Post coital ache
  - Dysmenorrhea
  - Dyspareunia
  - Bladder irritability and rectal discomfort
  - Recurrent lower extremity varicosities
- No evidence of inflammatory disease
- Pelvic congestion syndrome is supported by either of the following imaging results:
  - Ultrasound demonstrates one of the following:
    - Tortuous pelvic veins diameter of >6mm
    - Slow blood flow <3 cm/sec or reversed caudal flow
    - Dilated arcuate veins in the myometrium communicating between bilateral pelvic varicose veins
    - Polycystic changes in the ovaries
  - CT or MR of the pelvis demonstrates one of the following:
    - Four ipsilateral tortuous para-uterine veins with a diameter of >4mm
    - An ovarian vein diameter of >8mm

## Non-indications

Due to the lack of evidence supporting the clinical benefit over other treatments, the following indications for vascular embolization are considered to be not medically necessary:
• Genicular Artery Embolization (GAE)
• Hemorrhoidal embolization
• All other indications not listed in this guideline

## Evidence Discussion

### Embolization for Hemorrhoid Disease

Catheter directed hemorrhoidal embolization for rectal bleeding due to hemorrhoids has shown promise as a safe and minimally invasive technique in several small studies. Clinical success rates have ranged between 63 and 97% in small studies. Large studies have not been completed and long-term follow-up beyond a year is limited. A 2023 study by DeGregario et al reviewed a Spanish emborrhoid registry of 80 patients treated with embolization for Grade 1-3 hemorrhoids. Technical success was 100% but 31% of patients had recurrence of rectal bleeding at 1 year and 21% required repeat embolization with 5% having open hemorrhoidectomy. In 2021, Talaie et all reviewed the available studies and concluded that " Hemorrhoid embolization can preserve the anal tone and maintain the hemorrhoidal tissue in place requiring minimal local wound care on an outpatient basis. However, due to the paucity of high-quality trials, further research is warranted to evaluate its long-term outcomes, compare its efficacy with other treatment modalities, and full assess its role in the treatment of hemorrhoid." The Italian Society of colorectal surgery (SICCR) consensus statement in 2020 noted weak evidence (2C) for embolization in the management of hemorrhoids except in controlling bleeding in patients with contraindications for conventional surgery (1C). In May 2024, the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons Clinical Practice Guidelines for the management of Hemorrhoids, did not include embolization as part of the recommended management options.

#### Recommendation
There is not enough evidence to support routine use of arterial embolization for hemorrhoidal disease management.

### Geniculate Artery Embolization

Osteoarthritis is a common and potentially debilitating disease affecting 10-18% of the population above the age of 60. A chronic, low-grade inflammatory response

causes progressive damage resulting in pain, disability and quality of life issues. Early
stage management consists of anti-inflammatories, weight loss and physical therapy
to maintain function. Additional therapies including injections of anti-inflammatories,
lubricants and ultimately total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are used as the disease
progresses.

In 2014, Okuno et al identified the role of hypertrophied synovium and joint hyper-
vascularization in nociception. Subsequently they conducted a small study on 14
patients. They found that by treating this hyper-vascular inflammation with geniculate
artery embolization, all 14 patients experienced significant decrease in their mean
WOMAC total pain scores at one month with additional improvements by 4 months.
These improvements were maintained in most patients on follow-up examination at a
mean interval of 12 months. The mean overall VAS scores also significantly decreased
at 1 week, 1 month and 4 months as well.

In 2020, Bagla et al published on of the first randomized sham-controlled studies
of GAE. Fourteen patients were treated with GAE and seven were in the sham
control group. At one month VAS and WOMAC scores showed statistically significant
improvements compared with the sham procedure and all 7 control patients crossed
over to the treatment arm.

In 2021, The Society of Interventional Radiology Research Consensus Panel reported
the need for ongoing trials to assess the effectiveness of GAE for osteoarthritis and
that these be conducted as sham trials to insure appropriate results. It was noted that
placebo effect in prior OA trials may be as high as 40%.

Bhatia et al published a systematic review in 2023 for short-to-midterm outcomes of
GAE for mild to moderate osteoarthritis. A total of 13 studies and 399 knees were
included in their review. They concluded that GAE was a safe and effective procedure
for early and low-grade osteoarthritis in the short and medium term (1-24 months) but
more robust evidence is needed to confirm its role.

Limited data is available regarding patients with severe osteoarthritis but data suggest a
non-durable response.

There are currently no societal guidelines that support geniculate artery embolization for
primary treatment of knee osteoarthritis.

### Recommendation

Although geniculate artery embolization shows promise for short-to-midterm
outcomes for pain control and quality of life improvement in mild-to-moderate knee
osteoarthritis, further evaluation is needed to determine long-term efficacy and
appropriate patient selection.

Geniculate artery embolization for treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee is not
supported at this time.
